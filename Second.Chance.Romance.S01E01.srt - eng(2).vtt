00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.020
By the way, did you

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.500
properly thank

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.020
Ms. Wen yet?

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.540
Thank you, Ms. Wen.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:06.420
Don't mention it.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.820
Le worked hard for it.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.100
If Ms. Wen hadn't pushed you
to practice...

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.140
No, just busy eating away.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.700
Alright, wait here.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.740
I'll go get the car.

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:16.380
Okay.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.260
You carry on.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.100
Button up your collar.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.420
There was a part before you arrived.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.180
I recorded it.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.020
So cool.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:31.500
Don't look.

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.340
Focus on driving.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.140
I'll play it for you.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.420
Breaking news.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.100
Renowned ballet artist

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.540
Tan Siting

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.340
has announced her retirement
and returned home today.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.660
Tan Siting, often called
the Pride of Chinese ballet,

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.540
has decided to return home.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.220
Reports say

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:43.940
she's retiring

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.500
to return home and pursue teaching work.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:47.580
Let's wish

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.780
the former ballet goddess Tan Siting

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.940
all the best in her future endeavors.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.980
Now, here's a lovely song for everyone.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.060
"Chengdu Love Story".

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.260
Thanks, Yuan.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:13.940
I haven't felt

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.660
this relaxed in a long time.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.140
Don't mention it, big artist.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.740
Back in the homeland,

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.260
of course you gotta enjoy
the good food and drinks.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.260
I finally realized

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.020
nothing beats the arms of homeland.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.140
So when are you coming into my arms?

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:30.780
Let me think.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.420
Maybe in the next life.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.140
That long?

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.420
Hey, stop messing around.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:38.620
Thank you.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.300
Get some rest.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:41.220
I'll head off now.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:41.500
Bye.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:41.980
Bye.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.020
Mom,

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.460
what brings you here today?

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:00.700
What?

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.380
I need

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.380
your permission to visit?

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:09.260
Rui.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.860
I want to get Le a new piano.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.340
His current one is still new.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.340
I can't make it.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:20.220
Can you

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:21.980
go pick one?

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.100
I don't know how to pick a piano.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:26.460
You don't have to.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:32.300
I have found a pro.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:47.660
She's back.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:49.340
Who?

00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.620
Her.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:03.460
I heard it

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:04.820
on the news.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:11.060
Rui.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.140
I know you've been

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.700
through a lot all these years.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.260
No need to bring it up.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.460
That was so long ago.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:26.540
I've forgotten about it.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.220
You really mean that?

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.260
Of course.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:39.980
Good.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.800
[Candy & Pastry Shop]

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:05.620
Excuse me,

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.900
do you still make
the Mini Puff without milk?

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:09.500
Our Mini Puff

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.420
has never contained milk.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.340
Even after all these years,

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.500
it's still made without milk?

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:14.500
Yes.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.100
I used to buy from your shop
all the time.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.100
Oh, so you're a regular?

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:19.980
How many would you like?

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:20.980
Just one.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:21.780
Sure.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.180
I hope the taste hasn't changed.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.020
Of course. You can try it.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:30.900
Thanks.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.540
Let's check in on the traffic now.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.260
There's a two-car rear-end collision

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.340
on Hantang Road heading southbound,

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.980
causing slow-moving traffic
in the section.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.860
Please drive carefully
if you're passing through.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:02.980
Right here is fine.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:03.340
Okay.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.340
That piano of yours
really does need replacing.

00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.260
Poor tuning can affect
a player's ear, after all.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:21.900
Sorry

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:23.500
to have taken up your time

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.380
and made you come so far.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.660
Don't be so formal with me.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.620
I'm the professional
when it comes to pianos.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:30.820
Happy to give you some advice.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:31.780
Right.

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.220
Thank you for your help.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:34.300
No problem.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:39.220
Excuse me.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:39.820
Sorry.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:16.460
Excuse me.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:19.580
Hello.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:20.820
I'm sorry.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:21.460
Is this yours?

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:23.140
Here.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:24.220
Thank you.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.780
No problem. Keep it safe.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:06.940
What kind of piano

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.580
are you looking for?

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.220
We have both upright and grand pianos.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.340
We can help you find the right one.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.180
Do you have the Yamaha YM50?

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:18.740
Yes.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:19.780
Right this way, please.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:20.340
Okay.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.540
May I ask

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.860
how old your child is?

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:26.340
Starting middle school soon.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.020
Alright.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.460
Look, this is the model.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:30.860
This one right here.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:34.580
May I try it?

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:35.540
Of course.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:36.980
Just a moment. Let me adjust it for you.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:37.380
Okay.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.020
What do you think...?

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.580
What's up

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:46.940
with you today?

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.260
You seem off.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.540
Like your mind is somewhere else.

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:53.500
Then

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.540
I'd better go find it.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.540
Alright. Please give it a try.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:58.460
Okay.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:20:59.700
Excuse me.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:00.260
Sure.

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:00.980
Thank you.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.460
The high notes are bright,

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:23.620
and the bass is rich and full.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:25.460
You play beautifully.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.660
You must be an expert.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:29.220
Then

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:30.580
we'll take this one.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:32.700
Here's the thing, sir.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:33.660
This piano

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:34.980
comes with a matching bench.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.980
Could you tell me
how tall your child is?

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:39.580
About

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:41.060
this high.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:41.940
One meter forty-nine.

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.460
Mom always knows best.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:44.980
Alright.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.860
Please wait in the lounge area.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.900
I'll check our warehouse stock.

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:50.500
Okay. Thank you.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.460
Mr. Feng, since winning the award,

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.140
have you been busier than before?

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:04.740
It should be a good thing.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.260
Just worried I'll have
even less time for Le.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.380
You and your mom
are both career-focused.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:12.340
But it's okay.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:13.420
Le is very understanding.

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.660
But what I said last time

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:17.940
wasn't just being polite.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.420
If you and your mom are busy,

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:20.220
you can really

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.700
leave Le with me after school.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:23.780
He's starting middle school.

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:25.020
He can take care of himself.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.820
You two even sound the same.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.020
But meals shouldn't be rushed.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.740
He can't always just order takeout.

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:34.580
I usually eat alone.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.220
Having Le over would mean

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:37.060
we could cook more dishes.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:38.940
But that's too much trouble for you.

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:40.980
Don't be so formal with me.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.700
You always like meeting me here.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:22:59.660
Because

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.060
I love this street.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.020
It always has a special feel to it.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.700
You sound like an old man.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:07.820
So profound.

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.300
Maybe I've been drinking too much tea.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:11.460
What do you feel like eating later?

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:13.460
Hotpot?

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:14.860
Sure.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.220

When you love it, it doesn't feel tough.

Let's go.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:38.300
Go.

Well,

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.340
can we exchange phone numbers?

They get along so well.

go for you two?

Peiyan

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:05.500
was a huge help.

She has great taste.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.340
Of course.

that she's so good to Le.

Don't go.

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.300
It's almost time.

these apples for you.

Thank you, Grandma.

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.420
Peiyan, thank you for your hard work.

00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:58.460
Not at all.

00:36:58.460 --> 00:36:59.500
Le is the one working hard.
Have some more.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:00.500
Eat up.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.700
Any plans later?

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:05.060
No.

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:06.620
Then come shopping with me.

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:08.780
Just the two of us. Without them.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:12.020
No problem.

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:29.500
I think we should

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:30.740
buy those shoes.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:32.740
Madam, that's enough.

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.220
We haven't been shopping long,

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.140
and you've already bought Le
two pairs of shoes.

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:38.500
Besides, kids at his age

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:39.740
outgrow shoes so fast.

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:40.140
It's enough.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:42.980
Yes, I know.

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.420
You shouldn't spoil a child.

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:46.780
I know that.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:48.540
But

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.500
I just can't help myself.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.260
But those shoes really are quite nice.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.180
You're right. They are nice.

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:00.340
Maybe you could think
about it a bit more

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:00.980
before deciding?

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:04.940
Let's sit down for a while.

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:05.420
Sure.

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:06.700
Let's go over there.

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.460
What do you think of Rui?

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:19.620
He's a good man.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:20.820
And we get along well.

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.900
Just seeing

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:24.740
how much he loves Le shows

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:26.140
how responsible he is.

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.100
Once, Le joked with me,

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:33.180
saying "If my dad ended up with Ms. Wen,

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:36.660
I'd be totally happy."

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.100
Le really likes you.

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:44.500
He talks about you all the time.

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:47.660
I also hope

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:49.700
that one day,

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:52.540
you and Rui might be together.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:54.060
That'd be wonderful.

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:01.660
Madam,

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:03.700
I understand what you're saying.

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.060
Let me be honest with you.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.020
Actually, I have feelings for Rui.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:12.940
I've also wondered

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.900
if we could take the next step.

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:20.620
But it always feels like

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:22.460
he's overly formal with me.

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:24.540
It's like he keeps me at a distance.

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:27.940
You've got the wrong idea.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.180
That's just how he is.

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:33.140
He doesn't treat me
and his dad the same way.

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:34.780
He treats his dad

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:36.820
like a friend.

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:39.180
He'd tell him everything.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:40.660
I have to admit,

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:43.140
I'm a bit jealous

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.620
of his dad over it.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:45.780
Thank you, Madam.

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:47.580
Have some more cake.

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:47.940
Okay.

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:53.380
Madam,

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:56.700
what was

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.660
Le's mom really like?

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:11.340
Back then,

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:13.460
they were so young.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:16.300
They were only thinking

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:19.140
about themselves,

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:21.580
with no idea

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:23.780
what real life was about.

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.180
What's past is past.

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:31.460
No need to bring it up.

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.460
We always have to look forward,

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:35.700
right?

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:37.300
Right.

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:38.860
Actually,

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:40.460
no matter which direction you look,

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:41.900
it's always forward.

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:44.660
Peiyan,

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:48.780
your words really put my mind at ease.

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:50.900
I think

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:52.220
you could be

00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:53.460
a bit more proactive.

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.700
I'm here for you.

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:57.180
Whenever you need me,

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:58.380
I'll help you.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:01.380
I understand, Madam.

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:11.740
Gao Hui.

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.580
You must've been waiting
a long time for this.

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:15.620
Leave Rui.

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:16.580
You murderer!

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:16.900
Get out!

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:17.940
Mom, stop making a scene.

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.660
I want him to see

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:20.540
what his good mother

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.020

Our family will never accept her.

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:30.060
