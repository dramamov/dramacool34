00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.840
Actually, I...

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.520
am a man.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.200
What?

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.080
This secret concerns the life and death
of my Nan family.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.280
You are a good person.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.800
I hope, since I saved your life,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.400
you'll keep the Nan family safe.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.880
Alright.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.360
Okay.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.880
I will.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.800
If I die,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.280
this marriage

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.480
will no longer exist.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.600
I...

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.480
But I hope you can let the Military
Imperial Examination

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.400
proceed smoothly.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.120
go forward.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.240
How do you know about
the Military Imperial Examination?

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.880
Chenxiao.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.800
Chenxiao.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.200
Chenxiao!

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.560
I will keep you safe.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.920
Trust me.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.120
Is anyone there?

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.600
Open the door!

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.920
Is anyone here?

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.800
Search over there.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.560
Leave no survivors.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.640
Yes.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.080
Rui Wang.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.680
Why are you here?

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.520
Mind your manners.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.240
Call me Second Brother.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.040
Weren't you in Pingxiang?

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.040
I'm here for business.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.600
But why are you here?

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.280
And in such a mess?

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.080
I can't explain everything now.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.480
Do you have forsythia here?

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.920
Large-leaf Green and Pulsatilla root?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.400
Yes, I do.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.720
I'll get them for you.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.400
Hurry up.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.280
This one.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.240
Come with me.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.320
Wait, wait.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.240
Let's go.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.520
Chenxiao.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.400
The campfire is still warm.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.960
It's been about half an hour.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.840
They should still be alive.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.960
Where are you going next?

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.920
I'll escort you there.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.240
The County Deputy's residence.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.840
Where exactly are you?

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.480
Second Young Master Rui.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.440
Well?

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.840
My people sent word.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.840
In Qirong City.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.000
No sign of your sister-in-law.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.720
Yu'er.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.280
Sir.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.480
Yu'er.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.560
At least eat something.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.640
Eating so little under stress

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.040
won't last long.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.800
I'm fine.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.600
When will the Pingxiang officials arrive?

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.440
Someone's already gone to fetch them.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.760
Young Prince.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.280
Don't worry.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.520
You'll soon return home.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.760
Brother Yu...

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.240
I...

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.400
I might not be able to go back.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.880
Why?

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.040
I was sent to Ling An at one year old.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.400
It's been fourteen years.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.920
Even my mother may not recognize me.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.080
They'll question my identity.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.680
That doesn't matter.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.200
As long as you show your personal seal,

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.480
you can prove who you are.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.200
Where is your personal seal?

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.680
I feared someone would steal it
while I was bathing.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.040
So I hid it.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.000
I was attacked right after dressing.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.120
I couldn't bring it out.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.080
Young Prince.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.200
Where did you hide it?

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.080
Under my bed in my room.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.600
I'll send someone to get it now.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:35.720
Lord Rui.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.200
The Pingxiang officials have arrived.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:38.880
Second Brother.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.800
Send someone quickly to find it.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.600
I'll go meet the Pingxiang officials first.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.600
I'll buy us some time.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.720
Then don't worry.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.600
Your health matters most.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:48.880
Lead the way.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.080
Please.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.120
Lord Rui, Lord Rui!

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.600
You've arrived.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.880
Thank you, Lord Rui,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.360
for escorting the Young Prince.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.160
It was a pleasure to see the border scenery.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.800
It was quite an experience.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.160
May I ask, the Young Prince—

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.800
where is he now?

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.240
The journey has been tiring.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.160
He's exhausted.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.040
He's still sleeping.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.480
He'll wake up soon.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.200
Then he'll come over.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.280
There's no rush.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.800
However...

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.040
We'd like to verify the Young Prince's
personal seal first.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.400
After all, when the Young Prince was in Ling An...

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.320
Are you saying

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.280
our Ling An

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.160
would swap him for someone else?

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.040
That's not what I meant.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.440
But it's better

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.120
to be cautious.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.440
Then do you know

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.040
the Young Prince was attacked at the border?

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.840
The assassin's sword

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.680
came from your Pingxiang army.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.480
This...

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.480
From our army?

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.760
That must be a misunderstanding.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.720
If today

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.840
I hand the Young Prince to you

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.600
and something goes wrong,

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.000
won't Ling An be blamed?

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.640
Lord Rui, that's too harsh.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.440
We

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.640
would never harm the Young Prince.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.440
Then please,

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.080
show the transfer document

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.240
for me to review.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.000
Why?

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.560
Why is the National Seal missing?

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.480
This...

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.080
If that's the case,

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.360
we can't hand over the Young Prince today.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.760
Once we enter Pingxiang tomorrow,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
please present the official transfer document.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.680
Then you may take the Young Prince.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.480
Lord Rui! Lord Rui!

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:53.680
Lord Rui.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.160
Lord Rui.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.320
Rui Yu.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.240
Don't worry.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.320
Everything will work out naturally.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.920
Do you really want me to owe you this much?

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.360
Yu'er.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:06.720
Lord Rui.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.800
There's a woman at the door

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.560
claiming to be Madam Rui, asking for you.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:10.720
I won't see her.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.320
Yes.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:13.840
Wait.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.520
Who did she say she was?

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.840
She said she's Madam Rui.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:19.360
Yu'er.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:19.640
My lord.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.800
I'll go get an umbrella.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.920
Nan Chenxiao.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.960
You're still alive!

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.320
What are you saying?

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.800
I thought you were dead.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.120
You get winded after just two steps.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.160
And you didn't even bring an umbrella.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.200
Can you handle it?

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.160
I'm just glad you're okay.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:17.480
I...

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.280
I...

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.520
Rui Yu.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:40.760
My lord.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.640
He's awake.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.240
Finally, you're awake.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.040
What happened to me?

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.480
You overworked yourself.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.400
You fainted, that's all.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.560
Get me some more soup.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.520
Just now,

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.400
I think I saw Nan Chenxiao.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.680
I'm full.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.240
How's your poisoning?

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.680
Thanks to you,

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.520
I'm mostly fine now.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.680
That's good.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.520
My people checked the post station.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.360
It's completely burned to ashes.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.400
There's nothing left.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.760
What should we do now?

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:30.960
Take a look.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:32.840
Is this

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.200
what you're looking for?

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.080
I'll ask the Young Prince to confirm.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.200
You just woke up.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.040
Just send someone else.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:51.280
Fu Lü.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.320
He should not be a lovesick fool in life.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.600
There's no place in this world

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.240
for longing and love.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:09.760
Young Prince.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.920
Please check if this is your personal seal.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.080
Yes.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.640
Thank you, Brother Yu.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.080
Mother once said

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.560
we must repay kindness.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.600
From now on, you're my brothers and sisters.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.040
Honored guests of Pingxiang.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.560
Tomorrow, you can return home.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.640
You'll see your mother again.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.880
Will we...

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.680
ever meet again?

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.640
When Hou Xian becomes King of Pingxiang,

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.080
he'll have responsibilities

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.840
beyond his own life.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.320
We are now ruler and subject.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.040
I'm afraid after this farewell,

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.760
we may never meet again.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:57.800
We definitely will.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.560
Brother Yu.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.040
This token belongs only to Pingxiang royalty.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.600
If you ever come to Pingxiang,

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.200
just show this token.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.360
No one will dare bully you.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.040
You must always remember

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.280
the mission you carry.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.080
I will be a good king.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.480
Just like Your Majesty of Ling An.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:24.520
I...

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.680
feel a bit uneasy.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.920
I suspect tomorrow's envoy

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.320
might be Hou Qi's man.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:32.920
That's not hard.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.880
I can escort Hou Xian out.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.400
If we thought of it,

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.000
so did Hou Qi's people.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.440
They'll expect it too.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.800
When we leave the city tomorrow,

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.360
they'll check anyone Hou Xian's age

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.480
very strictly.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.680
They have experts.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.560
But we have Fu Lü!

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:55.880
Let's go.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:56.680
The document.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.560
I didn't expect

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.160
Fu Lü can also disguise herself.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.160
She's still not as good as me.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.640
After all, I taught her.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.320
That's true.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.600
Your injury—

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.920
how is it?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Thanks to your quick help,

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.000
it's nothing serious.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.280
By the way,

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.240
you and Second Brother—

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.560
did you plan this in advance?

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.560
I only found out last night.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.720
He left home this time

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.360
just to come to Qirong City.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.600
You civil officials' families are odd.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.600
You even keep secrets from your own family.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.280
So,

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.000
how did you get to Qirong City?

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.320
Me?

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.560
When I woke up,

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:55.680
you were gone.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.600
I thought something bad happened to you.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.600
So I went out to look for you.

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.120
Where did Rui Yu go?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:18.760
I kept searching for you,

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.840
but even at dawn, you were nowhere to be found.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.240
So I decided to check Qirong City nearby.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.400
On the way,

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.640
I met a farmer.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:31.960
Miss,

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.040
come over here.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.120
I'll give you a ride.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.240
We can only take it

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.000
one step at a time.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.400
Found it.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.280
That man is a good person.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.360
I treated my wound again at his home.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.680
He even found me some clothes.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.360
Please have someone send them some money later.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.240
To show our thanks.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.400
I'll take care of it soon.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.400
Speaking of which,

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.560
it's so dangerous outside.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.840
Where did you go alone?

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:20.920
I...

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.840
went to get you medicine.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.240
But now it seems

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.120
you don't need it anymore.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.160
Is it for detoxifying?

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.400
I'll keep your secret for you.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.560
Please trust me.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:58.600
Understood.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.640
Actually...

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.840
I also have a secret.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.520
Miss.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.320
Sir.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.720
It's time to depart.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:14.960
Let's go.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.040
Where to?

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:17.800
To the market.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.960
Hou Xian has left the city.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.920
We should return to the capital and report.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.440
It's rare for us to get out.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.600
Who knows when we'll get another chance.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.040
We should enjoy ourselves while we can.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.480
He's a grown man,

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.240
stuck at home all day.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:33.440
It's truly pitiful.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.080
As you wish.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:38.640
Get ready.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.880
We'll go to the market soon.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.720
Young Master Nan,

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.880
you can wear men's clothes to have fun.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:50.800
Thanks.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:19:59.800
Your Highness.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.720
A message from Hou Qi.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.160
Besides asking for money and people,

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.560
what else will he do?

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.440
You mean...

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.760
Let’s stall for now.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.720
He needs to know

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.560
who he can touch

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.600
and who he can't.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.200
Your Majesty.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.280
About the assassination attempt,

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.560
Chongming has already reported back.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.040
On this trip,

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.520
did you discover anything else?

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.200
When I reached Ya'an,

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.880
I found the local post officials

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.280
were acting suspiciously.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:57.720
During the day,

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.920
there were no street vendors at all.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.520
After I was attacked at night,

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.960
I returned to Ya'an to seek medicine.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.080
Yet the patrolling soldiers on the road

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.160
did nothing about the commotion.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.240
I suspect

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.800
some border officials

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.600
are colluding with Pingxiang.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.720
Border officials

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.440
I'll assign someone to investigate their collusion with Pingxiang.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.960
The list of candidates from the local exam

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.520
and their essays

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.320
are being handled by the Hanlin Academy.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.560
Pay special attention

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.440
to examinees from border cities.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
I will go now.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.600
I take my leave.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.600
Sir, you must be tired from travel.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.840
Why not stay at Yuqing Cottage tonight?

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:48.560
No, thank you.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.440
Just prepare some hot water in my room.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:52.720
Yes, sir.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.800
You're back, Little Yu.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:56.960
Sister-in-law.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.200
You've just returned from a long trip.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.520
You should get some rest.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:01.560
But...

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.520
Prince Pan is here.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.480
Prince Pan?

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.920
Did he come to visit you?

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.000
Yes.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:08.440
Father said

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.360
to talk with you when you return.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.400
After all, you're the only official in our family now.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:14.680
I understand.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.040
Should we invite Chenxiao too?

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.640
Given his identity,

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.040
it's best he avoids contact with others.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.080
No need.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.640
Madam is also tired.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:24.720
Let him rest.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.400
Alright.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.400
Then go ahead.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.040
I'll have the kitchen serve the food.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:28.640
Okay.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.360
Your Highness, please have some tea.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.080
Thank you.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:40.680
Lord Rui.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.440
Your Highness.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.600
I only meant to visit my aunt.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.480
Didn't expect to trouble you as well.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.880
It's rare for Your Highness to visit.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.640
Of course you must stay for a meal.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.360
Thank you.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.720
No need to be polite, we're family.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.480
From now on,

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.200
just call Rui Yu

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.600
Uncle, that's enough.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.680
Lord Rui doesn't look well.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.560
I got an old ginseng root recently.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.360
When I return,

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.040
I'll send it to you.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.160
I appreciate Your Highness's kindness.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.120
I just haven't slept well from traveling.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.560
No need to worry.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.760
How could I not be concerned?

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.080
Miss

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.040
Reading while walking
will hurt your eyes.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.560
Why not wait a bit
before reading again?

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:26.880
Liang Jin

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.440
You can't call me "Miss."

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.880
No matter who's around,

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.960
you must call me Third Young Master.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.600
Yes, Third Young Master.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.120
Since that day,

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.160
I decided you would be my bride.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.040
But fate had other plans.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.520
Once I return to Qian Yuan
and claim the throne,

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.960
I can marry you openly.

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:47.960
By the way,

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.520
I heard

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.680
you ran into bandits
on your journey.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.800
You and Nan Chenxiao
almost fell off a cliff.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.680
That was truly dangerous.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.880
Were you hurt?

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.080
Those two...

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.480
Why are they so interested
in this trip?

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.000
Are they trying to test

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.280
Nan Chenxiao's identity?

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.320
We just ran into
some desperate men.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.880
I'm perfectly fine.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.120
Here, Prince.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.400
Eat, eat, eat.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.160
It's all cold now.
Come, come.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:26.760
Put it on.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.160
It looks nice.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.760
Miss Nan gave this today.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.400
Miss Nan brought gifts
for everyone.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.920
Everyone was so happy.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.360
He really went
to great lengths.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.120
So thoughtful.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.680
Little Yu

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:42.960
Are you asleep?

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:45.800
Little Yu

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:48.960
Hurry, put it on.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.960
Sister-in-law, wait.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:54.880
Come.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:01.560
Sister-in-law.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.440
What's wrong?

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.720
Sister-in-law wants
to talk to you.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:06.960
Let's talk inside, then.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:07.920
No, no.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:09.760
Big Brother.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.400
Why are you here?

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.720
It's late and damp outside.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:13.960
I was worried you'd fall
coming back.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.400
But there's a lantern.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.640
You've never rushed
to meet me before.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.040
I suddenly realized

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.840
Rui Yu just got to rest.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.200
Let's talk tomorrow
if it's important.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.800
I'll just say a few words.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.960
Might as well say it here.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:26.840
Sister-in-law.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.000
Go ahead, speak freely.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.280
Go on.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:31.920
You're already married,

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.800
but you sleep in the study
every night.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.120
If Your Majesty finds out,

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.240
he'll think the Rui family
disapproves.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.680
At least sleep in the main room.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.120
Sleeping in the study
every night...

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.200
This...

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.000
It really hurts Nan Chenxiao.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.640
I think your sister-in-law
is right.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.440
As long as you don't share a bed,

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.120
it's not a big deal.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:52.960
I mean...

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:53.760
So lively here.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.520
Big Brother, Sister-in-law,
why are you here?

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.160
Nan Chenxiao is here too.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.160
Then I'll just say it clearly.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:00.680
Madam.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.200
Let go.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.320
Let go, let go.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.280
Me,

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.040
I hope you two
live well together.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.680
You, every day,

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.200
make Third Brother
sleep in the study.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.680
That's not good at all.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.680
My husband is just busy.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.480
I just made some late-night food.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.920
I wanted him to eat
in the main room.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:19.400
How about, husband,

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.800
you sleep in the main room tonight?

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:21.920
Let's do that, then.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:22.920
So straightforward.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.160
I never said I disagreed.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.480
Sister-in-law just spoke
too quickly.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.720
Go with Nan Chenxiao
to the main room.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:31.960
Then, Sister-in-law,

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.960
I'll go back with your brother now.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:34.720
Take this.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:36.880
Hurry, go.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:37.880
You two,

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.160
take care.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:40.680
Take care.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.880
You should rest early too.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.320
Let's go.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.000
How nice.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:47.680
Really nice.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.040
Madam, let's go sleep too.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:49.440
Let's go.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:50.880
Watch your step.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.680
Hold it tight.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:02.600
What are you doing?

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.520
Let's head back.

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.640
Isn't this a bit much?

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.960
Why so fussy?

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.440
I've been squatting
for half an hour.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.640
My legs are numb.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:11.640
So much nonsense.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.360
Watch out, or I'll hit you.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.320
A trip really did
bring you closer.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.000
No, I need to give them something.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:31.960
Go, go, go.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:33.600
Go back.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.600
I didn't expect

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:50.880
You're pretty good at this.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.360
I just did what was needed.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:55.680
Otherwise,

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.760
Sister-in-law would never let it go.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:58.600
Then,

00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.640
your identity would be exposed.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:00.680
That would be bad.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.880
I think it's perfect.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.600
Why?

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:11.880
Stop pretending.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.800
I've known for a long time

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.440
who you really are.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.040
It's a dream.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.640
Forgive my boldness for saying this,

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.000
I have always

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.000
seen the princess as a little sister.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.160
Who wants to be your sister?

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.200
Princess,

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.400
today I

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.480
have said all I can.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.600
I hope you won't dwell on this.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.480
I'll head over there

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.680
and join the officials.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.720
Brother Yu,

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.120
Brother Yu,

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:10.600
I

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:11.800
take my leave.

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.760
Brother Yu,

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:19.600
Princess,

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:20.760
please don't—

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.040
Brother Yu!

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.000
Someone, help!

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.160
Rui Yu!

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:26.880
Hurry, someone!

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.720
Lord Rui fell into the water!

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:28.720
Hurry, someone!

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.880
Help!

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:31.680
Brother Yu!

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:36.800
Go save him, quick!

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:37.320
Yes!

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.600
Brother Yu!

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.000
Brother Yu!

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:43.840
Rui Yu!

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:44.680
Rui Yu!

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:45.920
Are you all right?

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.080
Quick, prepare a guest room.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.320
Let Brother Yu change his clothes.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:48.840
Yes!

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:51.680
No, you can't!

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.920
I can't stay here—take me away.

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:54.720
Don't speak yet.

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:55.680
I'm here with you.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.600
Brother Yu,

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.120
Where are you carrying me, Brother Yu?

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.600
Lord Rui,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.040
Brother Yu,

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:14.880
Brother Yu,

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:29.720
My lord,

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:30.160
Get in the carriage, quick!

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:30.800
What's wrong with my lord?

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:31.280
Go, hurry!

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.280
My lord!

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:33.720
Thank you, sister-in-law.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:36.800
Fu Lü,

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:37.520
Go boil some hot water.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.040
What happened here?

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:38.280
Quick!

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:38.600
Okay!

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.880
I'll get some clean clothes.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.040
Why did Yu faint?

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.280
No, I need to check on him.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.640
Nan Chenxiao is here, why worry?

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.200
Yu is frail.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.560
I'm afraid my sister-in-law

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:48.720
can't handle it alone.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.200
He's already married.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.720
Why not rely on his wife,

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.080
instead of you, his big brother?

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.640
I think

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.640
she truly is a general's daughter.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.560
She has such a noble spirit.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.400
Her stride

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.760
is swift as the wind.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.200
Is that what matters now?

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.840
Go get a doctor, now!

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.880
I think it's nothing serious.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.880
Do you even act like a brother?

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.560
Are you drunk?

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.080
Yu,

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:14.080
with Nan Chenxiao—

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.400
I'll go get her medicine.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.320
No,

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.240
what are you worried about?

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.400
Being the big brother

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.640
is just too hard.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:37.760
Careful!

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.960
Hot...

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.120
Could it be a fever?

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.160
Let me change your wet clothes first.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.360
Don't let it get worse.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.840
So hot...

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.000
A woman.
