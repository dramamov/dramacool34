00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.200
Mom

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:51.200
You're back.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.079
Um...

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.640
My dad is here.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.000
Isn't this that crazy guy?

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.759
Isn't this that fool?

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:19.080
I changed my look.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.919
She can't recognize me.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.719
She can't recognize me.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.560
Are they falling for each other?

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:31.879
Did someone mess up my dad's brain?

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:33.599
Say something.

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:35.960
Say something.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.800
Nice to meet you.

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:41.919
Please take care of me.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.039
What are you doing?

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.759
Didn't we agree not to use powers?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.240
I really can't hold it in.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.520
Seeing this old man makes me mad.

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.560
What's so hard for you to bear?

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.759
It's just the first meeting.

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:55.680
First meeting? Seriously?

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.759
The one who fought me outside just now.

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:59.520
That's him.

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:01.560
Changed his clothes.

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.039
Swapped shades for gold-rimmed glasses.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.800
Looks even creepier now.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.719
Can't win, just can't win.

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.240
New look, still can't beat him.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.520
Let me tell you something.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.639
Whether you can stay here

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.319
depends on their approval.

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.599
If they don't let me stay, I'll...

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.439
Don't threaten me with alien stuff.

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:19.599
What I say doesn't count.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.840
If you expose me,

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.680
you'll have nowhere to stay.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.599
Fine then.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.120
I'll cover for you.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.039
You help me stay.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.719
We'll see. Depends on you.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.199
What about these two?

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.719
Hurry and untie them.

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:32.400
This is their place.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.960
You need to get along with them.

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:35.400
Earthly social rules—

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.520
you haven't learned any.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.120
I will.

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.199
Co-in-laws.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.280
My mom is way too enthusiastic.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.520
How about we eat first?

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.719
Dad, we want to discuss something.

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.639
Yes.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.840
Mom came this time

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.879
planning to stay here

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.840
for a while.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.959
You just mentioned

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:26.319
how much it costs to release an album.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.360
One hundred thousand.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.519
A buddy of mine, his eldest son

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:29.519
works at a record company.

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:31.160
It's a lot of money,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.199
but

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.000
for our own album,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.560
it's worth it.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.279
Right?

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:38.120
But I heard

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.920
there's something called

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.800
fan crowdfunding now.

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:43.000
Seriously,

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:45.600
many bands release albums this way.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.120
Fans? We don't have any.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.199
Crowdfunding? We lack both.

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:49.120
Neither applies to us.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.360
It's not that much, actually.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.319
How about we old pals chip in?

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.759
Each puts in twenty-five thousand.

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:57.480
No, my money

00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:59.160
is all tied up in investments.

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.120
My money

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:03.600
was all donated to hospitals.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.319
I'm strapped for cash too.

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:07.839
But I live alone in a two-bedroom.

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:08.639
It's a bit of a waste.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.360
I could rent it out first.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.600
Let it

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:12.720
be three months' rent, three months' deposit.

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:13.959
That could get us some.

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:15.040
Where would you live then?

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.000
Me?

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.079
I'll stay at my son's place.

00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:17.920
He has three bedrooms.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.519
Dad.

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:21.240
Dad.

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:25.519
When are you leaving?

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.759
Dad.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.519
Why can't you make small talk?

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.000
Dad.

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:30.680
If you don't agree,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.000
my mom will leave right away.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.199
She won't say a word more.

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:34.439
Why should she?

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:36.480
You two are married.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.759
This is your home now.

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:38.639
Technically,

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:40.519
it has nothing to do with the old man.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.240
As parents,

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.639
don't meddle in your kids' marriage.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.600
Give them their own space.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.480
If that's the case,

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.480
it's even less your business.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.639
Why are you living in my house?

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.279
You lived in my house when you were little.

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:52.800
I didn't mistreat you.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.360
If you shrink, you can live here again.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.879
Fair.

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:55.319
Nonsense.

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:56.560
Can I live my life again?

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.560
There's always the next life.

00:05:58.519 --> 00:05:59.319
Let's

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.040
not reminisce for now.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.759
Eat, eat.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.079
Eat, try this dish.

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:04.079
This dish is good.

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:05.800
Eat up, hurry.

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:10.920
Is this your way of helping me?

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.839
Reverse psychology.

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:14.639
Who's the general here?

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:16.800
Don't just provoke me.

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:18.240
Stay calm.

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:21.959
Mom, are your eyes bothering you?

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:23.959
No, no, no.

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:24.480
Just now,

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.360
when I came,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.360
I didn't mention it so you wouldn't worry.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.839
When I arrived,

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.360
I bumped into the door frame.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.079
Are you okay?

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:34.160
I'm fine now.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.560
Not sure if there'll be any aftereffects.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.759
I'll leave after dinner.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.720
Darn it.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.040
Rent a small place in the suburbs.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.240
Live alone, nice and quiet.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.879
No one would notice if I stayed in for days.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.639
You guys, every few days,

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:49.800
give me a call.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.720
If I don't answer,

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.600
just call emergency services.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.040
The nearest hospital

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.759
is a two-hour drive away.

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:57.879
Might as well

00:06:58.079 --> 00:07:00.560
bring monks and priests along.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.759
I want my send-off to be lively.

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:03.600
No, no, please—

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.600
Mom, what are you saying?

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.879
Now that you're home,

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:07.600
just stay here.

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:09.000
There's a spare room anyway.

00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:09.759
Right, Lili?

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:12.800
Yes.

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:14.040
Is it suitable?

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.319
It's perfect.

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:16.639
If you live alone out there,

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:17.600
we'd be worried.

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:18.360
So,

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.319
is someone not okay with this?

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:22.680
I think

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.920
Lili and I

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.959
have no objections.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.000
Got it.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.399
I'm here to witness your family

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:38.800
happily reunited.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.879
That's truly in the rock spirit.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.040
I'm leaving.

00:07:57.639 --> 00:07:58.519
Come with me.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.720
No need. Isn't your e-bike broken?

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.680
You can't give me a ride anyway.

00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:02.439
Just go ahead.

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:03.800
The bikes will be gone soon.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.399
Alright, alright.

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:05.639
I'll head out first, then.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.720
Be careful on the road.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.079
Mom.

00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:13.279
Real estate elite.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.439
Still biking to work?

00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:18.160
It's a special case.

00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:19.279
I don't usually bike.

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:20.120
It's all electric.

00:08:21.519 --> 00:08:23.000
At his level,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.720
he should ride bikes indoors.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
In their social circle,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.160
they sometimes bike to work.

00:08:29.279 --> 00:08:30.399
It's about remembering the hard times.

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:32.360
Mom, I need to talk to you.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.519
Since you've moved in,

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.440
there are things you should watch out for.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.159
I get it.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:37.759
I've been through it.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.639
You two do your thing.

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:40.440
I go to bed early.

00:08:40.639 --> 00:08:41.759
What do you mean?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.879
I mean,

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.320
Meng Meng is starting to get suspicious.

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:46.600
Suspicious about what?

00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:48.360
That we're not mother and daughter.

00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:51.639
I said women need to take care of themselves.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.919
We don't look like mother and daughter together.

00:08:54.639 --> 00:08:55.960
So what do we look like? Sisters?

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.600
No.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.039
Your face shape is different.

00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:00.240
I take after my dad.

00:09:01.679 --> 00:09:02.639
After all these years,

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.919
I've forgotten what your dad looks like.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.120
It's been so many years.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.159
If only I had a dad and no mom.

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:10.240
In this life,

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.080
it'd be great not to see either of you.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.000
Don't worry.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.039
That'll happen soon.

00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:14.759
Just hang in there two more days.

00:09:14.759 --> 00:09:16.879
I'll send you off in style.

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:19.360
I'll add you to the family group chat.

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:20.840
To ease their doubts.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:21.759
You—

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:22.679
In the group, you must

00:09:22.679 --> 00:09:24.559
show lots of mother-daughter love.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.679
Really act loving.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.600
Your hands only know how to type.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.919
Can't cook.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.039
Mother-daughter love.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.720
Alright.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.840
Dear daughter,

00:10:03.159 --> 00:10:05.120
Mom will buy you fish soon.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.039
Humans are disgusting.

00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:15.200
Lao Meng—

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.360
He eats and grabs everything.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.120
You just have to stir up chaos.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:18.639
Did you see that?

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.559
But yesterday,

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:20.600
I didn't hear anything.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.840
He brought her to live at his place.

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:23.960
Yeah.

00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:26.799
Seems like her.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.360
No, no, no.

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:30.600
Looks pretty normal.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:31.840
Yeah.

00:10:32.159 --> 00:10:33.080
What are you saying about me?

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:33.919
No, no, not at all.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.120
Just chatting.

00:10:36.159 --> 00:10:37.120
Talking bad about me, right?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.039
Of course not.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.879
You're Lao Meng's co-in-law, right?

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:41.679
Yes.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:42.879
I am.

00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:43.919
Li Lili's mother.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.879
We're a very loving mother-daughter pair.

00:10:46.039 --> 00:10:47.879
Just like you ordinary Earth people.

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:51.120
Lao Meng never said that.

00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:52.759
So what did he say about me?

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.200
He said you have some flaws.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.720
Said you don't have a single friend.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:58.879
Lao Meng said

00:10:59.320 --> 00:10:59.960
he is

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.639
he's that—

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:01.399
What is it?

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.360
He said he's kind in word and deed.

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:07.279
You widows and orphans meeting him

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:07.799
that's

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.000
from a past life,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.399
a blessing you earned.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.399
Isn't it?

00:11:11.399 --> 00:11:12.039
Yes, yes.

00:11:14.879 --> 00:11:16.240
Getting worked up.

00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:16.960
Uh-oh.

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:19.600
Nice tea.

00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:20.360
Alright.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.600
As for me,

00:11:25.039 --> 00:11:25.759
I'm the head of the household.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.799
My word has to count.

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:30.519
I took her in out of kindness.

00:11:30.879 --> 00:11:31.840
She

00:11:32.679 --> 00:11:33.720
is endlessly grateful.

00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:35.440
Said she'd be my housekeeper.

00:11:35.559 --> 00:11:36.200
Well,

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.559
How could I agree to that?

00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:38.240
Right?

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:40.200
I said, "No need, no need."

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.080
I told her,

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.879
I said it's fine.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.679
Just settle in and live here.

00:11:44.879 --> 00:11:46.440
We'll all be family from now on.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.679
So,

00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:50.759
your son's place

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:51.600
is a bit crowded.

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:53.639
If that's not okay,

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.720
you can stay at my place.

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:56.639
Anyway, I

00:11:56.639 --> 00:11:57.559
live alone.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.159
You're so scheming.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.559
Full of tricks.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.320
This

00:12:07.159 --> 00:12:08.279
Well, you two go ahead and talk.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:08.799
You two chat first.

00:12:08.799 --> 00:12:09.200
Uh, well...

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.360
I'll go stretch my legs outside.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.799
I'll be outside, outside.

00:12:14.279 --> 00:12:15.120
Up so early, huh?

00:12:16.759 --> 00:12:17.559
If I get up any later,

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.679
the whole neighborhood will know I'm flawed.

00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:24.360
You have no idea.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.159
In the neighborhood,

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.639
those old men and women

00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:28.519
just love to gossip.

00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:29.600
It's too much.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.039
They say you said it.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.559
See, after making up stuff about you, now it's me.

00:12:34.559 --> 00:12:36.159
Not a single honest word from them.

00:12:36.159 --> 00:12:36.799
Seriously.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.559
I think so too.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.159
Let's go.

00:12:39.159 --> 00:12:40.039
Let's go curse them out together.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.279
No, no, no.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.279
No need, no need, no need.

00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:44.879
See, you don't know what to do now.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.039
For this, you just

00:12:46.039 --> 00:12:46.720
handle it coldly.

00:12:46.879 --> 00:12:47.919
Never respond, no matter what.

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:49.200
Wait for the buzz to die down.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.240
Everyone will forget.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.080
If you go now,

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:53.279
it'll just stir up trouble.

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:53.879
Right?

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.720
Have some tea.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.879
Is Meng Hang still comfortable living there?

00:13:02.919 --> 00:13:04.320
When are you leaving?

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:05.480
Not sure.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.519
I'll leave when my flight arrives.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.519
Waiting for a plane, huh?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.799
So you

00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:12.080
just stay as long as you like.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.000
Could be one or two days,

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:14.720
or maybe

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.399
one or two years.

00:13:17.159 --> 00:13:17.559
You

00:13:17.559 --> 00:13:18.440
taking a tractor?

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.200
Driving it all the way from Africa?

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.279
You just don't want to leave, do you?

00:13:23.919 --> 00:13:25.200
What do you have here?

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.039
Everything.

00:13:27.519 --> 00:13:28.080
Cat.

00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:28.960
Dog.

00:13:29.039 --> 00:13:29.639
Turtle.

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:30.200
Fish.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.279
Alpaca.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.679
This is the store's treasure.

00:13:34.159 --> 00:13:34.960
Lili

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.960
said in the group chat

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.279
she wants to eat fish.

00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:40.039
So you treat my place like a market.

00:13:40.559 --> 00:13:42.000
You have to pay at the market.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.120
This one's so fat.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.879
None of these are for eating.

00:13:44.879 --> 00:13:45.559
Can't eat them.

00:13:47.399 --> 00:13:48.200
This

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.399
Normally, it's all mother-daughter bond.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.720
But mention money for a fish,

00:13:53.279 --> 00:13:54.200
and it gets vague.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.120
So fake.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.480
I'm fake?

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.320
But Lili and Meng Hang in the group

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.480
both said they want fish.

00:14:00.559 --> 00:14:02.159
You just pretend not to see, right?

00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:03.919
And make me do it, huh?

00:14:04.519 --> 00:14:05.480
Well

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:06.960
I'll buy it, you cook.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:07.720
Fine by me.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.200
Go ahead, don't worry.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.519
I'll watch the store for you.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.159
Trying to trick me out of a fish, huh?

00:14:14.159 --> 00:14:15.080
Just wait.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.600
Liu Yingnian

00:14:19.679 --> 00:14:21.120
Heard you're starting a new class?

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.279
I'll be there soon.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.000
Okay, okay.

00:14:29.919 --> 00:14:30.720
So let's do this.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.720
Let's

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.559
twenty minutes.

00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:33.519
In twenty minutes,

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:34.559
let's meet at the neighborhood gate.

00:14:34.559 --> 00:14:35.159
Alright.

00:14:35.559 --> 00:14:36.159
Okay, okay.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:37.840
Meng

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:38.679
Heading out?

00:14:38.799 --> 00:14:39.559
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.360
Park Avenue.

00:14:41.559 --> 00:14:42.480
Going to see an apartment.

00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:45.159
Didn't your e-bike break?

00:14:45.159 --> 00:14:45.679
How are you getting there?

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.240
Shared bike.

00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:48.919
How far is Park Avenue?

00:14:48.919 --> 00:14:49.879
Shared what bike?

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:50.960
Take my bike.

00:14:51.159 --> 00:14:51.759
That's not right.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.840
Don't you have a client this afternoon?

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.480
It's hard to get a client.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.000
You have to seize the chance.

00:14:57.759 --> 00:14:59.200
Stop letting your boss yell at you.

00:14:59.879 --> 00:15:00.840
I can't stand watching this.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:01.840
Alright.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:02.879
Thanks, Lao Cha.

00:15:02.879 --> 00:15:03.440
Hurry up.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.000
Be careful.

00:15:11.559 --> 00:15:12.559
The teacher isn't here yet.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.000
Here you are again.

00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:14.399
Nice.

00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:15.240
You're not late today.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.360
Yeah, I knew you'd be here today.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.679
Had to get here early.

00:15:17.679 --> 00:15:19.240
You talk better than me.

00:15:19.799 --> 00:15:20.279
Lao Meng

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.559
Didn't you say you weren't coming today?

00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:24.159
I hired a temp for the store.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.240
Such a big store,

00:15:26.279 --> 00:15:27.600
left to a temp.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.679
You're really okay with that?

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.440
It's just a pet supply shop.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.600
Pay and get your stuff.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.279
What trouble could she cause?

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:37.799
Hello.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.480
Got a pretty auntie today.

00:15:41.159 --> 00:15:42.279
I want to buy that British Shorthair.

00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:43.320
How much is it?

00:15:44.279 --> 00:15:45.039
No need to pay.

00:15:45.039 --> 00:15:45.799
It's yours.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:46.879
With the cage.

00:15:47.799 --> 00:15:48.600
Thanks.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.679
The lady boss is so nice.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.399
You and the boss are a perfect match.

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:52.399
Just take it.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.399
Are you crazy?

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:56.759
Boss

00:15:56.879 --> 00:15:58.559
Can you check if my dog can be saved?

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.120
You're lucky you found this place.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.279
Can you save it?

00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:04.360
Why save it?

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:04.840
But

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.440
Dogs are on sale today.

00:16:06.559 --> 00:16:08.000
You can just buy a new one.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:10.679
Where's the person?

00:16:13.399 --> 00:16:14.840
Your dad passed away this afternoon.

00:16:23.679 --> 00:16:25.159
Mom, what's wrong with Dad?

00:16:25.559 --> 00:16:26.080
Exactly.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.759
He said he was going to buy fish
this afternoon.

00:16:28.159 --> 00:16:29.559
He asked me to watch the shop for him.

00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:31.240
But he still hasn't come back.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.639
You scared me to death.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.600
Then it's fine.

00:16:33.639 --> 00:16:35.159
He didn't go to buy fish.

00:16:35.159 --> 00:16:36.360
He went to slack off instead.

00:16:36.759 --> 00:16:38.679
Probably went to the senior college
to have fun.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.559
Just went to play.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.600
Treats me like free labor.

00:16:43.679 --> 00:16:44.759
Send me the address.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.919
So,

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.600
this Andromeda Galaxy

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.159
is the closest galaxy
humans can observe

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.360
to the Milky Way.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.639
It's the nearest galaxy.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Its diameter

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.559
is over 220,000 light-years.

00:16:58.679 --> 00:17:00.600
That's 1.6 times the Milky Way.

00:17:00.679 --> 00:17:02.080
So by

00:17:02.159 --> 00:17:02.879
calculating,

00:17:02.919 --> 00:17:03.840
we can figure out

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.240
the mass of the Andromeda Galaxy.

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:11.240
Here's the formula, come on.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.440
Which student can tell me?

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.119
It's been three years.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.920
A full three years.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:24.920
No one has ever

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.480
raised their hand in my class.

00:17:26.759 --> 00:17:28.839
No one has answered a single question.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.200
Uncle Meng, you're the first.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:31.720
Go ahead.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.920
Teacher, I just want to confirm

00:17:34.079 --> 00:17:35.559
what this class is about.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.640
What are we learning?

00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:41.599
No,

00:17:41.839 --> 00:17:43.039
this is astronomy.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.119
Isn't it obvious?

00:17:44.119 --> 00:17:45.480
It's all circles and lines.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.920
Is it cooking or something?

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:48.519
Teacher, I mean, I think

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.359
this knowledge,

00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:50.000
you should, you...

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.240
You should step out of science

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.240
and into real life.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.000
For example, Andromeda—

00:17:54.119 --> 00:17:55.720
what's its rising sign?

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.559
Right?

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.839
How does this sign handle Mercury retrograde?

00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:01.079
What's the personality of people
with this sign?

00:18:01.119 --> 00:18:02.079
Most importantly,

00:18:02.079 --> 00:18:04.119
if someone with this sign dates us,

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.119
which sign matches best with ours?

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.319
Your knowledge should cover

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.440
what regular folks care about.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.079
Right?

00:18:11.119 --> 00:18:11.680
Right.

00:18:12.079 --> 00:18:13.319
For example, Andromeda—

00:18:13.319 --> 00:18:15.440
is it a sun sign or a moon sign?

00:18:15.519 --> 00:18:16.519
Never heard of it.

00:18:16.519 --> 00:18:17.720
Does it even exist?

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.839
Of course it does.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.440
If not, how would I be here?

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.440
You're definitely not from Andromeda.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.440
You're from my pet shop.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.240
Didn't I ask you to watch the shop?

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.240
Why did you come here?

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.279
Didn't I tell you to buy fish?

00:18:28.279 --> 00:18:29.440
Why are you here?

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.359
I'm in class.

00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:33.319
This, this...

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.319
If you can't answer the teacher's question,

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.599
you can't leave class.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.240
Given

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.640
Andromeda's spiral arm speed is

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.680
170 kilometers per second.

00:18:49.799 --> 00:18:52.839
Now use the basic gravitational constant
to calculate.

00:18:53.119 --> 00:18:55.559
Andromeda's total mass is

00:18:55.559 --> 00:18:58.880
8.3542

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.880
times ten to the forty-first kilograms.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.720
That is,

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:09.640
1.14 trillion times the Sun's mass.

00:19:12.839 --> 00:19:13.799
Wait, you—

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
How could you—

00:19:15.799 --> 00:19:16.680
How do you—

00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:18.400
How did you figure that out?

00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:20.319
It's easy, even a three-year-old could do it.

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:21.240
It's common sense.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.279
Let's go.

00:19:23.359 --> 00:19:24.160
Don't just stand there.

00:19:24.279 --> 00:19:24.960
Go buy fish.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.960
Are you confused too?

00:19:33.799 --> 00:19:35.720
You're not even as good as
my shop's temp worker.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.519
You're worse than them.

00:19:36.519 --> 00:19:38.480
You really need to prepare your lessons.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.119
You should—

00:19:39.559 --> 00:19:40.200
You, you, you...

00:19:45.359 --> 00:19:46.400
That lady just now

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.799
must be a retired professor
from Tsinghua astrophysics.

00:19:48.799 --> 00:19:50.000
A retired professor.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.400
My car was parked here just fine.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.400
Someone scratched it.

00:19:58.079 --> 00:19:58.640
Who did it?

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.119
No one admits it.

00:20:03.319 --> 00:20:05.599
What's most important for us agents?

00:20:06.359 --> 00:20:06.799
Looks.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.839
Thick skin.

00:20:08.079 --> 00:20:09.079
Dare to lie.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:09.559
Who said that?

00:20:09.599 --> 00:20:10.839
Who, who said we lie?

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.640
What nonsense.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.000
It's honesty.

00:20:15.599 --> 00:20:16.960
Admit it now.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:17.880
It's not a big deal.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.440
If I find out myself,

00:20:19.799 --> 00:20:21.519
then it'll be a big problem.

00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:22.839
Everyone, just confess.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.079
You can't avoid it.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:26.640
Manager, this—

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.039
Start—

00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:29.039
Didn't even notify us before the meeting.

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:30.680
Took a client to see a house.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:34.960
Meng Hang.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.160
You specially modified this for me, right?

00:20:38.359 --> 00:20:38.759
No.

00:20:38.759 --> 00:20:39.519
This isn't my car.

00:20:39.519 --> 00:20:40.240
It's Lao Cha's.

00:20:42.359 --> 00:20:43.519
I searched all day for the keys.

00:20:43.519 --> 00:20:44.880
Turns out you took it.

00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:46.200
Didn't you lend it to me?

00:20:46.759 --> 00:20:47.440
Meng Hang.

00:20:47.799 --> 00:20:48.839
I've said before,

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.160
we're all colleagues.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.519
Use it whenever you want.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.400
But—

00:20:52.559 --> 00:20:53.720
How could you be so careless?

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.200
You scratched the boss's car.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.079
It wasn't me.

00:21:00.079 --> 00:21:01.519
We caught you red-handed.

00:21:01.519 --> 00:21:03.319
Did the boss scratch his own car
to frame you?

00:21:03.319 --> 00:21:04.960
Would he scratch his own car?

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:05.880
I...

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.799
What do you mean, "I"?

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.440
I can tell at a glance it was you.

00:21:22.039 --> 00:21:23.400
The fortune teller said that I

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.400
would take the blame all my life

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.359
with nowhere to cry about it.

00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:27.640
But

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.680
I don't agree.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.359
I think we're all just here to work.

00:21:35.079 --> 00:21:37.359
Is it worth risking your life

00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:39.720
over a little car repair money?

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:43.839
Lao Cha

00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:46.000
has worked with me the longest,

00:21:47.079 --> 00:21:48.359
but has the worst character.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.519
About this,

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.559
do you admit it or not?

00:21:53.279 --> 00:21:54.599
Make your own choice.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:55.839
Meng Ge

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.160
Meng Ge, I really know I was wrong.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:57.920
Please give me a chance.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.759
I'm begging you, really.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.039
Talk to the manager for me.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.880
Explain what really happened.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.599
I was in a rush this morning.

00:22:04.599 --> 00:22:06.079
I accidentally scratched it.

00:22:07.599 --> 00:22:08.279
Scratched it.

00:22:09.079 --> 00:22:10.000
How did you scratch it?

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.480
Show me how.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.480
Meng Ge

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.519
Like this.

00:22:16.359 --> 00:22:16.920
Manager

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.000
Did you see clearly?

00:22:18.079 --> 00:22:18.839
It was like this.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.720
Didn't see it clearly.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.480
Do it again.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.640
Like this.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.960
Did you see it this time?

00:22:25.079 --> 00:22:25.319
I

00:22:25.319 --> 00:22:25.960
still didn't see it clearly.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:26.799
Scratch it again.

00:22:28.119 --> 00:22:28.640
This

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.160
way

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:29.559
scratch

00:22:29.559 --> 00:22:30.039
Again.

00:22:30.079 --> 00:22:30.599
This

00:22:30.599 --> 00:22:31.119
way

00:22:31.119 --> 00:22:31.640
scratch

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.160
it.

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:34.200
Manager

00:22:34.559 --> 00:22:35.519
Did you see clearly?

00:22:35.599 --> 00:22:37.039
That's how I scratched it.

00:22:39.039 --> 00:22:40.079
Still didn't see it.

00:22:40.079 --> 00:22:41.319
Meng Ge, Meng Ge, Meng Ge

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.119
I saw it clearly.

00:22:43.119 --> 00:22:44.480
I was wrong.

00:22:46.359 --> 00:22:47.400
I was wrong.

00:23:05.119 --> 00:23:06.519
You're responsible for fixing it.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.559
Did you hear me?

00:23:07.799 --> 00:23:09.160
Did you hear me or not?

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.519
Okay, manager.

00:23:38.079 --> 00:23:41.079
It's to make Meng Hang think we have a mother-daughter bond.

00:23:41.079 --> 00:23:42.960
It's not like we really have a mother-daughter bond.

00:23:43.119 --> 00:23:45.079
Strengthen it again soon.

00:23:45.079 --> 00:23:46.920
So Meng Hang gets a fixed impression.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.359
Easy, just wait.

00:23:50.839 --> 00:23:53.079
Whenever you ask, I always have time.

00:24:00.079 --> 00:24:00.839
602

00:24:01.519 --> 00:24:02.319
Well,

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.680
I'll wait for you there.

00:24:09.519 --> 00:24:10.480
Later is fine.

00:24:10.759 --> 00:24:11.640
It's cooler later.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.559
Anytime works for me.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.000
Alright, bro.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:16.960
See you tomorrow.

00:24:17.279 --> 00:24:18.079
What are you doing?

00:24:19.319 --> 00:24:20.200
Client.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.359
Looking at a house.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:22.680
Client.

00:24:25.839 --> 00:24:27.519
You've been chatting since you got off work

00:24:27.519 --> 00:24:28.880
all the way till midnight.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.519
What house are you looking at?

00:24:31.319 --> 00:24:32.720
Your heart.

00:24:36.039 --> 00:24:37.200
Darn it.

00:24:38.319 --> 00:24:39.119
Lao Cha

00:24:39.799 --> 00:24:41.559
Today I took the blame for Lao Cha.

00:24:41.559 --> 00:24:42.640
To thank me,

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.640
Lao Cha gave me a client.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.039
Who knew this lady would be so tough?

00:24:46.039 --> 00:24:47.720
She kept asking me questions nonstop.

00:24:48.279 --> 00:24:49.519
And I can't offend a client.

00:24:52.839 --> 00:24:53.920
If something was really up,

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.000
would I text right in front of you?

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:56.799
Check for yourself.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.079
What do you mean?

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.720
I'm not looking.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.720
No trust at all.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:03.920
Why even get married then?

00:25:06.119 --> 00:25:06.920
That's fine then.

00:25:08.079 --> 00:25:09.880
Next time, don't slam my laptop so hard.

00:25:10.279 --> 00:25:11.599
That cost over eight hundred.

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.200
I'm going to the bathroom.

00:25:21.839 --> 00:25:22.519
Stop.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.039
Mom.

00:25:27.279 --> 00:25:28.119
What are you doing?

00:25:30.599 --> 00:25:31.200
Hand it over.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.079
What?

00:25:32.319 --> 00:25:33.039
Your phone.

00:25:33.759 --> 00:25:34.839
I heard everything.

00:25:35.039 --> 00:25:36.240
Lili is too shy to look.

00:25:36.359 --> 00:25:37.319
But I'm not.

00:25:37.519 --> 00:25:38.319
No, Mom,

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.119
this has nothing to do with you.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.720
How does it not concern me?

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.240
We're a pair,

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.319
a mother and daughter with a deep bond.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.599
It's my duty

00:25:47.599 --> 00:25:49.440
to protect my daughter from harm.

00:25:50.079 --> 00:25:51.480
If I

00:25:51.839 --> 00:25:53.440
hesitate, it means I'm guilty.

00:25:56.799 --> 00:25:57.440
Password.

00:25:58.079 --> 00:25:58.880
Lili's birthday.

00:25:59.039 --> 00:25:59.640
Which day?

00:26:00.079 --> 00:26:00.880
June thirtieth.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.839
You don't remember that?

00:26:02.319 --> 00:26:03.440
Don't change the subject.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.880
Let me check the chat history.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.559
Hang Hang,

00:26:07.799 --> 00:26:09.440
have you had dinner?

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.400
Don't wear yourself out.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.640
Who's this woman?

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.000
My mom.

00:26:14.279 --> 00:26:15.160
You have a mom?

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.640
Didn't your mom divorce your dad ages ago?

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.720
Why?

00:26:20.799 --> 00:26:21.799
She hates my dad.

00:26:22.759 --> 00:26:24.039
Your mom's taste is alright.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.640
But I've never replied to her.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.039
Just like Lili.

00:26:29.279 --> 00:26:30.359
If you're not family,

00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:31.920
you don't enter the same house.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.319
I checked everything, nothing's wrong.

00:26:34.319 --> 00:26:35.079
Go to bed early.

00:26:54.759 --> 00:26:55.599
Last time, the assign—

00:26:55.599 --> 00:26:56.400
—the assignment we got

00:26:57.319 --> 00:26:58.519
was about our

00:26:58.519 --> 00:26:59.839
album's concept theme.

00:26:59.839 --> 00:27:00.880
Has everyone thought about it?

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.720
Let's share our ideas.

00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:04.279
I have an idea.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.519
Let's use what's most important

00:27:06.519 --> 00:27:08.559
to people our age as the theme.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.200
Freedom.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.400
Love.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:14.920
No, that's not it.

00:27:15.799 --> 00:27:16.799
It's insu—

00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:17.319
—lin.

00:27:17.319 --> 00:27:18.000
Insulin.

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:20.440
We can't live without it.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.400
It's a great invention.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.000
I want to praise it.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.599
Next, next.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.920
I think it should show

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.880
the spirit of rock.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.160
Rebellion.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.359
Wildness.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.039
My theme is

00:27:34.359 --> 00:27:36.039
Party till 8:30 p.m.

00:27:36.519 --> 00:27:37.559
I think,

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.519
after our comeback,

00:27:39.799 --> 00:27:41.000
our first album

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.640
can't be too small.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.680
It has to be big.

00:27:44.359 --> 00:27:45.440
My theme is

00:27:45.799 --> 00:27:46.640
Jiuxianqiao.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.720
Lao Shang, that's not very big.

00:27:50.319 --> 00:27:51.200
None of these work.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.319
Then you suggest one.

00:27:54.759 --> 00:27:55.279
I agree.

00:27:55.279 --> 00:27:56.039
We need to

00:27:56.279 --> 00:27:56.680
go big.

00:27:57.039 --> 00:27:58.279
We should head for the distance.

00:27:59.319 --> 00:28:00.039
Wander.

00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:02.640
No, even bigger.

00:28:03.119 --> 00:28:03.920
Earth.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.160
Didn't you say

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.079
we'd do original work

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.000
and not buy copyrights?

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.720
Even bigger.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.799
Bigger than Earth.

00:28:13.799 --> 00:28:14.400
That would be

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.640
the Sun.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.279
I thought of one today—

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.039
Andromeda Galaxy.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.480
Andromeda Galaxy.

00:28:20.519 --> 00:28:22.119
That's a great theme for us.

00:28:22.119 --> 00:28:23.519
What's that supposed to be?

00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:25.880
I have class next week.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.640
Once I learn it, I'll teach you.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:28.759
This—

00:28:28.759 --> 00:28:29.400
—this—

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:30.799
Alright, alright.

00:28:31.319 --> 00:28:31.839
Lao Meng.

00:28:32.319 --> 00:28:32.960
So,

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.920
how's your part of the funding?

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.480
No problem.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.759
I've already rented out my place.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.640
So you're staying at your son's?

00:28:40.839 --> 00:28:42.279
I was supposed to stay there.

00:28:42.279 --> 00:28:43.519
But my son's mother-in-law

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.079
moved in first.

00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:46.640
I don't get along with her.

00:28:47.839 --> 00:28:48.839
So where are you staying?

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.160
Yeah,

00:28:50.319 --> 00:28:51.039
where are you living?

00:28:53.319 --> 00:28:55.480
Come on, everyone, let's work harder.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.839
Hurry up and move.

00:28:59.039 --> 00:29:01.079
Come on, everyone, let's work harder.

00:29:01.839 --> 00:29:03.000
Careful.

00:29:03.119 --> 00:29:03.799
Don't bump into anything.

00:29:03.799 --> 00:29:04.480
Slow down, slow down.

00:29:04.799 --> 00:29:05.319
Alright.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.119
Careful, careful, careful.

00:29:08.119 --> 00:29:08.519
Slow down.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.039
These things

00:29:10.039 --> 00:29:11.119
are all my treasures.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.640
Handle them gently.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.519
Take your time, no rush.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.720
What's up, Dad?

00:29:14.759 --> 00:29:15.200
This, this—

00:29:16.519 --> 00:29:17.039
Alright.

00:29:17.039 --> 00:29:17.400
Dad.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.079
This—

00:29:19.519 --> 00:29:19.960
—this—

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:20.640
No—

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:21.920
What does this mean?

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:22.920
No—

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.519
As for me,

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.880
living in a two-bedroom is wasteful.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.400
I can stay at the pet shop.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.519
So I thought I'd rent it out.

00:29:29.519 --> 00:29:30.079
Make some money.

00:29:30.079 --> 00:29:31.200
That's called financial planning.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.039
I'll leave my stuff at your place for now.

00:29:33.519 --> 00:29:34.039
No—

00:29:34.039 --> 00:29:35.319
You can't do that.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.799
You didn't even ask me about renting.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:38.880
Why would I ask you?

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.000
Well,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.039
Meng Meng's a real estate tycoon.

00:29:43.039 --> 00:29:44.880
He has lots of agencies.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.400
Just eat, don't worry about it.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.039
Actually,

00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:50.440
I just wanted to be quick.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.519
Rent it out fast.

00:29:51.519 --> 00:29:53.240
I heard the agency next door

00:29:53.559 --> 00:29:54.599
is pretty good, I—

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:56.680
You guys go.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.559
No, Meng Hang—

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.400
So,

00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.440
Dad just didn't want

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.160
to disturb your work.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.160
Didn't want to trouble you.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:01.599
Right?

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.279
Right, Dad?

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.200
Dad.

00:30:04.319 --> 00:30:05.519
Why don't you move in

00:30:05.519 --> 00:30:06.519
and live with us?

00:30:07.279 --> 00:30:08.680
I wouldn't dare.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.440
Live with the kids?

00:30:10.839 --> 00:30:11.319
No—

00:30:11.319 --> 00:30:12.400
I'm really afraid of bothering you.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.519
It's not right, not right.

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:15.319
Then the pet shop—

00:30:15.319 --> 00:30:16.839
If he wants to stay, let him.

00:30:16.839 --> 00:30:17.799
It's pretty spacious.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.440
You dare mention the pet shop?

00:30:19.759 --> 00:30:20.799
Let you watch the pet shop,

00:30:20.799 --> 00:30:21.599
just two hours,

00:30:21.599 --> 00:30:23.000
six orders, five bad reviews.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.559
Wasn't there one without a bad review?

00:30:24.839 --> 00:30:26.960
An old lady came and scolded me herself.

00:30:28.279 --> 00:30:30.039
Bad fame is still fame.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.599
You should be thanking me.

00:30:37.839 --> 00:30:38.480
Lili

00:30:38.839 --> 00:30:39.359
Lili

00:30:39.359 --> 00:30:40.680
Hurry up, I can't hold it anymore.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.359
What's wrong?

00:30:43.559 --> 00:30:44.599
You're not in there, are you?

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.319
Isn't it obvious?

00:30:47.079 --> 00:30:48.319
Then Mom must be inside.

00:30:48.319 --> 00:30:49.200
Go hurry her up for me.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.079
I really can't hold it.

00:30:50.079 --> 00:30:50.640
Quick, quick!

00:30:51.119 --> 00:30:51.759
Mom

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:53.440
Mom

00:30:53.559 --> 00:30:54.440
What's up?

00:30:55.559 --> 00:30:56.960
You're not in there, are you?

00:30:57.039 --> 00:30:58.279
Isn't it obvious?

00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.759
Then who's inside?

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:03.480
Dad

00:31:03.599 --> 00:31:04.200
Waiting in line.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.039
No.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.960
Aren't you living at the pet shop?

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.160
Yeah, but the pet shop isn't convenient.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.160
Just borrowing your bathroom.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.200
Hurry, hurry!

00:31:12.759 --> 00:31:14.559
I left my toothbrush in there.

00:31:14.599 --> 00:31:15.880
I just come by each morning to brush.

00:31:16.599 --> 00:31:17.119
Okay.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:18.559
This...

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.480
Can't eat this.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:24.759
Don't worry.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.519
I

00:31:25.519 --> 00:31:26.880
I absolutely won't bother you.

00:31:34.319 --> 00:31:35.359
Did he wash his hands?

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.640
Good thing Mom's out at noon today.

00:31:45.119 --> 00:31:47.480
We finally get to enjoy this sunny lunch.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:48.799
Here.

00:31:53.039 --> 00:31:54.319
Sorry, sorry.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.319
Uh...

00:31:55.599 --> 00:31:57.119
Mind if I use your kitchen?

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.519
Well...

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:07.680
Can't help it.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.000
No gas at the pet shop.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.279
Borrowing your kitchen.

00:32:10.759 --> 00:32:12.079
Just making some instant noodles.

00:32:13.839 --> 00:32:14.640
Dad

00:32:15.359 --> 00:32:16.759
Come eat with us.

00:32:16.759 --> 00:32:17.640
No, no, no.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:18.240
I said I wouldn't bother you.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.400
Definitely can't bother you.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:19.920
No.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:20.799
It's fine, it's fine.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.319
Hang Hang,

00:32:24.319 --> 00:32:25.319
when you were little,

00:32:25.559 --> 00:32:26.759
you'd eat instant noodles,

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.480
and leave half a bowl of soup.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.680
That was enough for me.

00:32:29.759 --> 00:32:30.480
Now,

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:31.799
things are better.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.000
I get a whole bowl of noodles.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.119
So happy.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.359
A man in his sixties

00:32:43.359 --> 00:32:45.359
kicked out by his unfilial son,

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.240
forced to live with cats and dogs,

00:32:50.599 --> 00:32:52.200
abused by his daughter-in-law,

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.160
survives on instant noodles.

00:32:54.559 --> 00:32:55.319
Talking about me?

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.799
What's with this guy?

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.599
Old father struggling alone outside,

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.960
while son and daughter-in-law enjoy life at home.

00:33:18.119 --> 00:33:18.880
Meng Hang

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.240
Maybe let your dad

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.440
just stay here.

00:33:22.519 --> 00:33:23.480
But like this now,

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:24.799
it's even harder.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:26.920
I'll talk to him later.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.079
It's just...

00:33:29.079 --> 00:33:30.880
He comes and goes as he pleases.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.640
No sense of boundaries at all.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.359
Mom

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.359
You're eavesdropping again.

00:33:36.359 --> 00:33:37.519
We should change the lock.

00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:38.920
No privacy at all.

00:33:39.039 --> 00:33:40.319
Lao Meng doesn't live here.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.559
He doesn't live here,

00:33:41.559 --> 00:33:43.400
but half the stuff here is his.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.599
Especially all this toilet paper.

00:33:45.319 --> 00:33:46.640
Why stockpile so much?

00:33:46.839 --> 00:33:48.279
Is he running a public restroom?

00:33:48.599 --> 00:33:49.519
I stocked that.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.680
Mom really cares about us.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.559
She's just worried we'll run out.

00:33:55.759 --> 00:33:57.000
It's not for you.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.920
Then keep it in your own room, okay?

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:11.960
Meng Hang

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.239
I've always heard people say

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:15.960
living with parents after marriage

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.159
causes conflicts.

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:18.159
So I thought,

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.239
let your dad move in too.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.960
I'll study this relationship in depth.

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:24.239
Better not.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.320
It's fine.

00:34:25.559 --> 00:34:26.320
He

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.559
is used to living alone.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.079
He likes hanging out

00:34:29.079 --> 00:34:30.360
with his rock band buddies.

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:31.119
Just spending time together.

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:32.159
See?

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:35.280
This...

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.519
This is all them.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:37.679
Those old buddies.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.039
Your dad seems pretty young.

00:34:40.039 --> 00:34:40.519
Yeah.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.800
If I die,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.719
the bank card password is

00:34:52.119 --> 00:34:54.000
three four five six seven eight.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:55.599
What's this?

00:34:58.159 --> 00:34:59.079
A will.

00:35:01.239 --> 00:35:02.760
Doesn't he live alone?

00:35:03.199 --> 00:35:04.239
Maybe he's worried

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.519
one day

00:35:11.719 --> 00:35:13.639
Your dad seems carefree,

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.199
but he's actually thoughtful.

00:35:18.599 --> 00:35:20.480
He rented the place for me this time.

00:35:20.639 --> 00:35:22.239
So he can leave me more money.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.639
And then

00:35:23.639 --> 00:35:24.480
he knows

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.519
my job isn't great.

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.880
He wants me to have it easier.

00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:32.440
Maybe that's just how parents are.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:35.679
Mom

00:35:36.599 --> 00:35:36.960
Yeah.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.000
Yes, yes.

00:35:40.119 --> 00:35:42.079
I could write that too.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.039
But I really don't have any money.

00:35:56.119 --> 00:35:56.719
No need, no need.

00:35:56.719 --> 00:35:57.239
Dad.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.039
I...

00:35:58.039 --> 00:35:58.519
Dad.

00:35:58.639 --> 00:35:59.840
Just listen to me, please.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:00.159
No, that's not it.

00:36:00.159 --> 00:36:00.880
I live

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:01.639
in the pet shop.

00:36:01.639 --> 00:36:02.119
It's pretty good.

00:36:02.119 --> 00:36:03.000
I'm used to it now, really.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.280
Just listen to me this once.

00:36:04.639 --> 00:36:05.840
You're not young anymore.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.039
Stay close to us.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:08.840
We'll feel more at ease.

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.079
We can look out for each other.

00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:10.920
Honestly, I just

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.719
don't want to trouble you.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.400
Dad.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.000
We're all family.

00:36:15.119 --> 00:36:17.039
Two families.

00:36:17.679 --> 00:36:18.400
Don't mind her.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.599
We're family.

00:36:19.599 --> 00:36:21.440
There's no trouble at all.

00:36:21.599 --> 00:36:22.280
Alright, alright.

00:36:22.519 --> 00:36:23.639
I'll listen to you kids.

00:36:23.639 --> 00:36:23.840
Okay.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:24.239
Alright.

00:36:24.239 --> 00:36:25.320
I'll go tidy up for you.

00:36:26.159 --> 00:36:26.519
This...

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:28.920
Yes, yes, yes.

00:36:29.639 --> 00:36:30.440
This...

00:36:33.519 --> 00:36:34.480
I appreciate your kindness.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.360
I understand.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.760
Here, take this.

00:36:39.199 --> 00:36:40.480
You're still in good shape.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:41.880
Don't overthink it.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:42.840
No, that's not it.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.400
Where did you find this?

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.000
It's right here in the album.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.840
It made me feel a bit sad.

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.320
I wasn't sad at all when I wrote it.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.800
I was really happy, you know?

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.599
I wrote this song for the boss's birthday.

00:36:55.039 --> 00:36:55.800
Later, on his birthday,

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.639
when we performed it,

00:36:56.679 --> 00:36:57.440
halfway through,

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.800
the boss kicked us off stage.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:02.159
Lyrics.

00:37:02.679 --> 00:37:03.199
That's right.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.639
If I die,

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.320
the bank card password is

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:12.039
three four five six seven eight.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:16.840
This...

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.039
This song is pretty good.

00:37:18.159 --> 00:37:18.880
My new album—

00:37:19.039 --> 00:37:20.559
I have to include it, definitely.

00:37:20.719 --> 00:37:21.840
You're releasing an album?

00:37:22.199 --> 00:37:22.760
Yeah.

00:37:23.119 --> 00:37:24.519
I rented out my house

00:37:24.519 --> 00:37:26.440
just to fund my new album.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:27.880
Well, well, well...

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.000
This is really nice.

00:37:30.039 --> 00:37:30.880
Good, good, good.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.920
This song, I

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:32.920
must use it, for sure.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:33.519
This...

00:37:34.079 --> 00:37:35.280
From now on, in the mornings,

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:36.760
from five to seven,

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.800
I'll be doing vocal practice.

00:37:38.119 --> 00:37:38.800
So...

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.880
don't disturb me, okay?

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.800
With your voice,

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.039
when you sing, we have to practice escaping.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:45.880
Practice, practice, practice.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:46.719
No, the main thing is,

00:37:46.719 --> 00:37:48.239
my new lead single

00:37:48.239 --> 00:37:48.880
is a bit challenging.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:49.960
I need to get back in shape.

00:37:50.159 --> 00:37:51.199
A new song, Dad!

00:37:51.199 --> 00:37:51.920
Yes, yes, yes.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.320
What's the new song called?

00:37:55.079 --> 00:37:55.800
Someone

00:37:57.159 --> 00:37:58.440
from the Andromeda Galaxy.

00:38:39.719 --> 00:38:41.000
Earthlings are so fake.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.239
That Lao Meng—

00:38:42.239 --> 00:38:44.519
I could tell right away he wants to move in.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.760
He just won't admit it.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.199
As for Meng Hang,

00:38:47.199 --> 00:38:48.519
he says he welcomes me,

00:38:48.519 --> 00:38:50.920
but when he sees me, he turns and goes inside.

00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:52.519
And Lili—

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.199
she's only been on Earth two years,

00:38:54.199 --> 00:38:55.639
and already cares about appearances.

00:38:55.719 --> 00:38:57.760
She wants me to act out the mother-daughter bond.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.039
A house full of actors.

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.039
And they think they're all so great.

00:39:02.039 --> 00:39:04.480
I found one truly genuine person.

00:39:04.639 --> 00:39:05.480
Old Gao.

00:39:05.559 --> 00:39:07.519
He keeps asking me to stay at his place.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:08.840
I've already called the police.

00:39:09.679 --> 00:39:11.760
It's not that you shouldn't be real.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.519
It's just that he disgusts me.

00:39:14.599 --> 00:39:15.559
Me, I'm the type

00:39:15.559 --> 00:39:17.840
who always says what's on my mind.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.199
Not like Earthlings—

00:39:19.199 --> 00:39:20.639
always mentally exhausted.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:21.840
I believe

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.239
instead of torturing yourself with mental exhaustion,

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:24.880
it's better

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.320
to go crazy and let it out.

00:39:26.519 --> 00:39:27.679
Make others suffer instead.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:28.719
No.

00:39:28.719 --> 00:39:29.800
Take you, for example.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.400
You should really give your boss a hard time.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.400
Your editor-in-chief.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:32.880
Right?

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.880
Look at him.

00:39:34.159 --> 00:39:34.840
Mom.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.119
I still have to get his approval, Mom.

00:39:37.039 --> 00:39:37.880
Doesn't matter.

00:39:38.199 --> 00:39:39.440
That editor-in-chief of yours—

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.159
if you ask me,

00:39:40.159 --> 00:39:41.480
he's a total fool.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.119
I'm telling you,

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.840
you don't need to bother with him.

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:46.280
You know?

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:46.840
Let me tell you—

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:47.920
when you see him, just

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:48.880
bam, bam, bam!

00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:50.039
And then,

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.159
just pinch him.

00:39:52.519 --> 00:39:53.159
See?

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.840
Look, you're still working for him.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:55.679
Look at me—

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.159
I've died eight times for him.
