(This drama is based on
a true story.)

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.040
(The plot was adjusted
for entertainment purposes only.)

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.040
(We have no intention
to offend any careers,)

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.040
(encourage immoral sexual values,)

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.040
(or create a pessimistic disposition
of a gender or a group of people.)

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.840
(We would like to apologize in
advance for any misunderstandings.)

(Presents)

(Theory of Love)

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.240
Are you stalking me?

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.640
You really don’t trust me that much?

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.440
For some people,
no matter how good you are to them,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.760
if they’re not grateful,

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.920
they’ll never treat you
the same way.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.640
I still believe my goodness
can change her.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.800
And what if it can’t?

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.240
You told me to trust you,
but this is how you act?

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.560
Is my trust
worth nothing to you?

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.640
Fon.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.880
Please give me another chance.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.160
I’ll give you another chance,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.560
but you have to move in with me,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.240
Thank you.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.680
Eat up.
Who are you texting with?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.200
I’m talking to an agency.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.800
It’s about work.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.160
I want to talk to you about that.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.440
I don’t want you
doing photoshoots anymore.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.200
These gigs are what’s stopping you
from leaving your old life behind.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.840
But I don’t know
how to do anything else.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.840
Then don’t.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.800
Just do nothing
and I’ll support you.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.320
Anything you want, anything you want
to eat, just tell me.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.000
I can even give you an allowance.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.840
You’re already supporting my child,
and now you’re going to support me?

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.560
Being a writer doesn’t pay
that well, does it?

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.280
You’re right.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.120
But if I say I’m going
to do something, I’m going to do it.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.640
Even if I have to exhaust myself
writing for you, I’ll do it.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.960
It’s fine.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.720
But if you really want
to help me,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.840
why don’t you take online courses
and build some new skills?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.600
You might be more capable
than you think.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.160
When you find a job you like,
you can go back to work then.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.960
All right?

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.920
Eat up.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.880
It will get cold.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.040
Let me warn you.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.640
She’s not your average girl.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.920
She’s got a reputation

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.040
for sleeping around.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.200
A few people in my office
have slept with her.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.040
One, two, three.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.000
Sexier.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.200
One, two, three.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.840
Tell me what you saw.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.320
I'll let you see for yourself.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.200
Fon.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.800
Fon.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.160
Get me my medicine
in the orange container.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.400
(Ms. Varisa Wiboontham
Sertraline, antidepressant)

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.760
It’s empty.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.560
Let’s go to the hospital.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.960
Walk slowly.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.600
Long time no see. I thought
you were getting better.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.640
I’m working hard again now,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.920
so the stress is back.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.200
Based on your symptoms, it appears
your workload has gotten heavier.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.640
Like I told you,

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.280
if you stress about work
and your personal life,

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.320
your symptoms will get worse.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.480
I’ll prescribe the same medication,

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.880
but if you don’t get better,

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.080
you'll need to get an MRI.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.480
Is it that serious?

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.280
Yes.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.280
Chronic stress

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.200
can develop into
severe brain-related conditions.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.040
What’s happening to you right now

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.680
is a warning.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.840
You’re having these symptoms because
you’re stressed about me, right?

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.880
Who said that? It’s because of work.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.880
I have writer’s block,
but I keep pushing myself.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.040
You keep pushing yourself
because of me.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.720
You tried to finish your work

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.240
so you could support me, right?

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.560
You’re overthinking.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.840
Even without you,
I’d still be like this,

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.440
just maybe a little less.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.520
Fon.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.160
Don't worry.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.880
Everything will be okay.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.000
Just stay by my side
and cheer me on.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.880
All right?

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.600
I’ll pick up my medication,
and then let’s go home.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.720
(Delete)

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.760
(Delete)

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.280
Let's go.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.560
(Bua)

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.200
- Hello?
- Where are you?

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.000
I came to see you at your place.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.440
I’m at the hospital,
about to head home.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.760
Okay.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.480
Who was that?

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.120
It’s Bua.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.720
Your symptoms right now

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.400
are because of Namhom.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.920
They’re getting worse.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.720
Honestly, how could you give
someone like her another chance?

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.760
She’s been behaving better.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.840
And I decided to give it my best.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.320
Even if I get hurt, I’ll accept it.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.120
Get hurt?

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.160
You’re not hurt enough already?

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.240
I am,

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:39.720
but I can still handle it.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.280
Come on, Fon.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.120
I’m your friend.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.400
I just don’t want
to see you get hurt.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.880
That’s why I had someone follow her.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.360
You can stop everything now.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.200
- But you...
- Fon has made herself clear, Bua.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.960
I’m talking to my friend,
stay out of it.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.920
I won’t,
because you’re talking about me.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.560
Honestly, what did I ever do to you
to make you hate me this much?

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.760
You didn’t do anything to me,
but you’re hurting my friend.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.160
Fon is trying to change me.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.800
It’s not just her.
I’m trying to change too.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.280
So give me some time.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.760
I can give you time
if this is about your personality.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.840
But if it’s about
your true nature...

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.840
- Bua.
- What?

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.160
If it’s about your true nature,

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.240
- then you’ll never change.
- Bua!

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.320
- What?
- That's enough.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.920
Stop fighting.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.080
Bua, you should go.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.800
Fine, I'll stay out of it.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.840
I'm just worried, as a friend.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.320
Once you realize that being good
doesn’t work with everyone,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.760
you’ll see what I mean.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.040
Is it good?

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.760
(Baan Fah Mai Childcare Center)

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.840
What’s the surprise?

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.520
Wait a little longer.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.080
- Are we there yet?
- Almost.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.480
- All right.
- There you go.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.120
What’s the occasion?

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.600
Marry me.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.840
I thought I never wanted
to fall in love again,

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.320
but you made me realize

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.320
that I still need love.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.720
Fon.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.200
Until death do us part.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.720
You were almost romantic

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.120
until you mentioned death.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.840
That’s really how I feel.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.560
I’ve never once thought about
breaking up with you.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.120
If we ever part,

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.120
let it be only in death.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.760
I'll marry you.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.400
I love you.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.240
Can you really marry me?

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.040
Your friend hates me.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.800
Bua?

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.480
Don’t mind her,
she’ll understand one day.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.200
Bua probably thinks I can’t change.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.680
You’re overthinking it.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.800
You’re adorable,
who would hate you?

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.360
Fon, I have something to ask you.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.400
I’m really bored at home.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.680
I really want to work.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.360
You haven’t been home long,
and you’re already bored?

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.440
What do you want to do?

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.040
Here.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.160
It’s not a photoshoot,
but it’s behind-the-scenes work.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.960
I think I can handle it.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.360
Your friend’s
looking for an assistant.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.040
Are you sure?

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.360
I don’t think Bua would approve.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.120
You can ask her for a favor.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.400
I really want this job,

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.760
so I can take
some of the burden off you.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.480
I also want to show Bua

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.720
that I’m not
the same person anymore.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.080
Please.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.680
Pretty please.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.680
Please?

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.640
Please ask her for a favor.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.840
Fine, I'll talk to her.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.840
You're the best.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.680
You're the best, Fon.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.040
I asked her to marry me.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.240
You’re my friend,
so please open up to her.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.240
No.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.960
Give her a chance.
I’m sure she’s changed.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.880
Fine, I’ll give her a chance.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.760
Thank you so much,
you’re my best friend.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.920
Don’t flatter me.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.720
I’m giving her a chance

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.560
because I want to see
if she can actually change.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.440
I have to go.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.360
Bye.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.160
You're so annoying.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.280
Can you adjust the cloth
at the back?

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.920
If it’s too high, take it off.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.640
Yes, just like that.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.360
Move it.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.440
Move the plant.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.360
It’s blocking the basket.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.440
- Is this okay?
- Come look at the monitor.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.160
Move it to the left.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.920
- Hello, Wut.
- Hello.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.840
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.680
Nat.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.520
Move the plant.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.200
Okay, that's right.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.200
Bua, hello.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.280
Here.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.800
This is the breakdown I prepared.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.760
It might not be completely right
since it’s my first time,

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.080
but I did my best.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.640
Okay.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.240
And this is

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.760
your breakfast.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.440
Please take it. I know you like it.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.080
You did your research,

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.520
but next time,
focus on work-related things.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.400
No need to look into
my personal life.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.080
I can’t do that.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.360
As an assistant,
I need to know everything.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.760
What you like, what you dislike.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.480
And when it comes
to the things you dislike,

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.000
I have to know
what to do to change your mind.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.400
Are we ready?
We start shooting in half an hour.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.400
- All good?
- Yes.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.240
Are the lights ready?

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.960
Okay.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.680
(Good luck for today.)

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.960
I think the pose looks a little off.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:18.040
I want you to show your curves more.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.440
You can lift your arms.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.240
I’ll help.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.840
Come on.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.200
- Ouch.
- Bua.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.640
- Ouch.
- Are you all right?

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.960
Walk slowly.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.600
Beautiful.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.880
We just need two more shots.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.280
Act cheerful.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.400
All right, that's a wrap.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.800
Amazing.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.640
You're amazing.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.400
- Cheers.
- Woo!

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.320
Have fun tonight. It’s on me.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.320
I’m gonna cry, Bua’s paying.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.440
Come on, I always pay.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.040
Be this cheerful
when you work too, okay?

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.240
I’ll head out now.
Have fun, everyone!

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.240
Namhom, why don't you stay
and drink with us?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.600
It’s okay, I need to rest.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.480
Don’t get too drunk.
I worry about you.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.400
Cheers.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.200
Are you tired?

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:04.840
Not at all.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.160
How’s working with Bua? You’ve been
with her for weeks now, tell me.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.240
It's good.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.760
I feel like Bua doesn’t hate me
as much as she used to.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.680
I'm going to take a shower.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.040
And this is your breakfast.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.480
Please take it. I know you like it.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.760
- Ouch.
- Bua.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.720
Don’t get too drunk.
I worry about you.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.600
Cheers.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.280
Fon.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.160
I forgot my ring at the studio.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.720
I need to go back and get it.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.800
Do you want me to come with you?

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.680
It’s okay. I’ll be right back.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.080
Namhom.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.760
You still don’t trust me?

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.360
No, it’s late.
I’m just worried about you.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.160
Don’t worry.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
I’ll be right back.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.680
I’ll call you.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.200
Here.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.760
The team already left.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.400
Why are you still here?
Are you stressed?

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.600
Like I said,

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.960
stay out of my personal life.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.280
How could you forget

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.120
something so important?

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.040
Who would take responsibility
if you’d lost it?

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.240
I didn’t mean to leave it here.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.280
It just gets uncomfortable
when I wear it for too long.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.680
If Fon heard that,

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.520
she’d be really hurt.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.800
So don’t tell her.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.520
It’ll be our secret.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.480
I’ll have a drink.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.600
Did Namhom go back to the studio?

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.320
Yes, I’m with her now.
Don’t worry.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.920
Bua.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.480
Can I be honest with you?

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.880
I wouldn’t be surprised

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.720
if you still don’t trust me.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.400
Actually...

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:28.240
I’m not even sure
if I’ve really changed.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.200
Fon...

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.480
She’s the best person I’ve ever met
in my entire life.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.880
She has such high hopes for me.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.920
She really wants to change me.

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.880
And I’m trying too.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.920
But it’s so hard.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.120
No matter how hard I try,

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.400
I don’t feel

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.320
like I can become a good person.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.280
I feel so uncomfortable.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:45.840
Sometimes I feel like

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.480
if I went back to the way I was
and lived the same life,

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.080
it would be so much easier.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.000
But I don’t dare go back.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.160
I don’t even know what I want.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.160
I’m just trying
to do my best every day,

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.480
as much as I can.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.880
I want you to know

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.600
that if I make another mistake,

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.480
it’s not because I want to.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:52.800
I don’t want to be a bad person

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.200
or hurt anyone.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.960
I’m probably just lost.

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.600
Well...

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.960
Everything you just said...

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:30.840
Do you want me

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.320
to feel sorry for you

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
and

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.560
understand you?

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.320
No.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.520
I want you to understand.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.520
And if you do
and you still hate me,

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.640
then that’s fine.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.240
I have to go.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.160
Ouch.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.400
Bua.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.760
You’re drunk. I’ll take you home.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.880
This isn’t my place.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.360
Don’t say no.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.840
I know you want me.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.120
(Namhom)

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.120
(Bua)

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.120
(Namhom)

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.000
- Where are you?
- I...

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:44.080
I’m calling to let you know
I’m staying at my place tonight.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.240
It feels a bit dangerous for me
to go to your place right now.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.400
Why? What happened?

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:56.080
When I was leaving the studio,
I felt like I was being followed.

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.360
My place was closer,
so I came back here.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.640
I'll pick you up.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.240
It's okay.

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:08.240
You should go to bed. It’s late.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.320
See you.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.680
I'm sorry.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.520
I still like
being desired by people,

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.640
especially by those who hate me,
like you.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.640
Fon.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.640
I'm here to take you home.

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.200
We're getting married.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.360
I hope I don't need to call
before coming over.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.720
Hey.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.600
Will you be here
until tomorrow morning?

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:00.840
If you see my girlfriend,
let me know.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Who’s your girlfriend?

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.000
Don’t pretend you don’t know.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.560
I see you staring all the time.

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.440
Fine.

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.280
Come in.

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.160
Are you up?

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.120
Oh no!

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.560
Do you know
I was really drunk last night?

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.400
Yes, I know.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.880
Why did you let that happen?

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.720
You didn’t want
to be the only bad one,

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.760
so you dragged me down with you?

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.520
I’m not a bad person.
I just made a mistake.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.800
It’s because I’m lost,

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.200
just like I told you.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.800
You can make a mistake with anyone,
but not with me.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.000
Darn it.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.120
Come on, Bua.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:45.680
If we don’t say anything,
how would Fon ever find out?

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.360
Don’t make me
feel even guiltier toward my friend.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.040
Calm down.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.800
Just wait and see.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.040
I’ll do everything

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.480
to make Fon break up with you.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:01.640
Oh, really?

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.200
If I have to break up with Fon,

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.560
then you’ll have to stop
being her friend too.

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.040
If I show her this photo,

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.600
what do you think will happen?

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.640
You’re not lost, Namhom.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:25.200
You’re a horrible person.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.440
Fon’s on her way up.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:39.960
If you’ve got something
to say to me, say it quickly.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.760
Darn it.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:36.240
Did Namhom really go back last
night to get her ring, Bua?

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:37.760
Did you actually see her?

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.480
I did.

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.200
What’s wrong?

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.560
She didn’t come home last night.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.640
So she might have gone out
with someone else.

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.240
Probably not.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:51.360
You told me she’s changed.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.600
Don’t overthink it.

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.360
Aoy and Chod, that was another time

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:07.160
when I had to make an effort
to trust her.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.160
But it’s really hard.

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.720
Even though my friend
confirmed her story,

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.160
I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:27.080
I know what to do
to find out the truth.

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.680
- I’ll keep you posted.
- Fon.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.360
Goodness only has meaning

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:13.560
when we understand
who is truly worthy of it.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:16.720
Be careful.

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.880
You did that on purpose, didn’t you?

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.160
Yes, because she was flirting
with you.

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.000
I’m your girlfriend.
I have feelings too.

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.600
Did something happen
at work today?

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.840
I’m spying on her at her place.
She didn’t go out.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.200
Come here.

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.600
- Let go.
- I am not

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.880
- a good person, like my friend.
- Let go of me, Bua.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.840
May I see the CCTV footage?

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.320
I want evidence of the guy
who hurt my girlfriend.

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.000
I don't think it's a guy.

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.200
- Here.
- Are you sure this is the person?

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.360
Now I finally understand
how it feels to be proposed to.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.440
Don't smile.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.160
Have an evil look.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.720
Don't smile.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.080
Like that.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.200
Action.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.760
Keep going.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.120
Okay, cut.

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:16.760
Cut.
