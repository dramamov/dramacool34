00:01:00.105 --> 00:01:03.185
Have you spoken with Kate
since this happened?

00:01:03.265 --> 00:01:07.025
There's nothing left to talk about. From
what I saw, there's nothing to explain.

00:01:07.105 --> 00:01:10.425
I'm sorry
I can't be the daughter you're proud of.

00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:12.145
Do you want to know

00:01:12.225 --> 00:01:15.065
why I asked Lin to think again about Kate?

00:01:15.145 --> 00:01:17.985
You can't stop being her daughter.
You're her daughter.

00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:19.585
You have to go back and face it.

00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:22.185
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

00:01:32.785 --> 00:01:34.105
Dad,

00:01:35.705 --> 00:01:38.105
did you buy me any snacks?

00:01:38.185 --> 00:01:39.865
Here you go, they're all yours.

00:01:39.945 --> 00:01:41.145
Thank you.

00:01:58.505 --> 00:01:59.545
Dear…

00:02:02.265 --> 00:02:04.065
where are you going?

00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:05.305
Let go.

00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:10.584
Hey.

00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:14.625
Your daughter's sitting right here.
Don't you feel bad for her at all?

00:02:20.865 --> 00:02:21.985
I said let go.

00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:26.705
Hey.

00:02:27.385 --> 00:02:29.625
You're leaving with that shameless woman?

00:02:29.705 --> 00:02:31.625
Why don't you find someone
who's not married?

00:02:31.705 --> 00:02:33.665
-Enough.
-He already has a wife and a kid.

00:02:33.745 --> 00:02:34.745
I said enough.

00:02:34.825 --> 00:02:36.065
That's his kid!

00:02:36.145 --> 00:02:37.425
You shameless bitch!

00:02:37.505 --> 00:02:38.825
You shameless bitch.

00:02:38.905 --> 00:02:40.345
That's enough!

00:02:41.065 --> 00:02:42.185
Mom!

00:02:43.465 --> 00:02:46.985
Mom, are you hurt? Why did you hurt Mom?

00:02:47.065 --> 00:02:50.065
Don't drag the kid into this. I gave you
the house, what more do you want?

00:02:50.145 --> 00:02:53.185
And you're not going to help
raise your daughter?

00:02:57.025 --> 00:02:59.865
Do you want Lin to come live with me?
Do you?

00:02:59.945 --> 00:03:03.105
If it's not here, you'll never have her.

00:03:18.545 --> 00:03:19.545
Dad…

{\an8}SOMETHING IN THE HEART

00:03:29.505 --> 00:03:33.705
{\an8}SOMEONE IN THE HEART

00:03:53.865 --> 00:03:56.905
Jane, go wait at home first.
I'll come after.

00:04:10.345 --> 00:04:11.825
Aren't you going to talk to me?

00:04:14.985 --> 00:04:17.624
I only have one parent, and that's my mom.
I never had a father.

00:04:18.944 --> 00:04:20.345
You left me when I was a kid.

00:04:21.545 --> 00:04:23.185
I can barely even remember your face.

00:04:30.185 --> 00:04:31.825
I just wanted to talk to you

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:34.025
about W Magazine.

00:04:35.665 --> 00:04:36.865
You don't have to worry about me.

00:04:37.465 --> 00:04:40.305
I've been fine almost
my entire life with just Mom and me.

00:04:40.385 --> 00:04:42.785
I've already thought carefully
about what I do.

00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:44.945
I'd never do anything
to cause her or myself trouble.

00:04:50.105 --> 00:04:52.425
Mom may be too polite to say this,

00:04:53.705 --> 00:04:54.545
but I'm not.

00:04:55.945 --> 00:04:58.625
You should go, and don't ever come back.

00:04:59.385 --> 00:05:00.945
Everyone here is fine.

00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:03.545
We're happy,
and we can live just fine without you.

00:05:05.065 --> 00:05:07.825
Don't make Mom
have to push you out herself.

00:05:29.545 --> 00:05:31.425
Mom, why did you let him in?

00:05:36.305 --> 00:05:38.105
Don't cry, Mom.

00:05:46.425 --> 00:05:48.105
Don't let him in again.

00:06:26.505 --> 00:06:29.865
{\an8}LEK PATCHARANUN - PHOTOGRAPHER

00:07:03.825 --> 00:07:05.225
Mom, do you remember

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:10.865
when you said you didn't want me
to work in the same field as him,

00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:14.785
that you didn't want
our paths to cross again?

00:07:22.745 --> 00:07:24.185
But you know…

00:07:27.705 --> 00:07:29.745
deep down, I wanted to see him.

00:07:32.705 --> 00:07:35.585
I wanted him to see
that I could be the best.

00:07:38.985 --> 00:07:40.505
I wanted him to know

00:07:41.745 --> 00:07:44.505
that you could raise me well
all on your own,

00:07:45.305 --> 00:07:47.305
without a father.

00:07:54.225 --> 00:07:56.065
I'm proud of you, Lin.

00:08:00.385 --> 00:08:03.145
I know you're strong,

00:08:03.785 --> 00:08:06.385
but I'll always worry about you.

00:08:09.065 --> 00:08:10.545
Before I die,

00:08:11.345 --> 00:08:13.425
I just want to see you have a good career

00:08:14.265 --> 00:08:17.145
and someone who truly loves you.

00:08:19.305 --> 00:08:22.265
Even though things
with Kate didn't work out,

00:08:23.305 --> 00:08:26.865
at least you still have a good job.

00:08:36.105 --> 00:08:36.945
Yes, Mom.

00:09:02.425 --> 00:09:04.585
He never came back once after he left.

00:09:06.665 --> 00:09:09.145
But as soon as he heard about the W deal,
he showed up.

00:09:11.105 --> 00:09:12.505
I don't even know what he wants.

00:09:15.105 --> 00:09:16.505
How's your mom?

00:09:17.105 --> 00:09:18.345
Crying.

00:09:28.065 --> 00:09:29.265
There must be a lot to process.

00:09:36.865 --> 00:09:40.145
When things calm down,
I'll tell her about my job.

00:09:51.585 --> 00:09:52.545
Hello?

00:09:54.545 --> 00:09:56.385
Yes.

00:09:56.465 --> 00:09:57.665
That's me.

00:10:03.145 --> 00:10:04.025
Yes.

00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:07.705
Sure.

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:12.065
Yes, of course.

00:10:13.985 --> 00:10:16.065
Someone called
to offer me a photoshoot, Jane.

00:10:16.145 --> 00:10:18.945
See? It doesn't have to be Pie's magazine.

00:10:19.025 --> 00:10:20.625
Plenty of people want to work with you.

00:10:22.065 --> 00:10:23.865
They asked me to shoot an interview set,

00:10:23.945 --> 00:10:26.145
but when I asked who the model is,
they wouldn't tell me.

00:10:26.825 --> 00:10:28.985
Whoever it is,
I'm sure it'll turn out great.

00:10:31.585 --> 00:10:34.825
Come on. Things will work out.

00:10:36.105 --> 00:10:37.305
Then,

00:10:38.065 --> 00:10:39.985
let's go out for something nice
to eat tonight.

00:10:40.065 --> 00:10:42.665
Celebrate your new gig, okay?

00:11:11.985 --> 00:11:13.265
Are you getting dressed?

00:11:23.345 --> 00:11:24.225
You smell amazing.

00:11:24.945 --> 00:11:26.305
Then come smell me again.

00:11:33.345 --> 00:11:34.425
You're hungry?

00:11:36.305 --> 00:11:37.305
Just a sec.

00:11:51.065 --> 00:11:52.585
Wow,

00:11:53.385 --> 00:11:55.305
so this is the "something nice"
you mentioned?

00:11:56.585 --> 00:11:58.425
Because the food here
is the most delicious.

00:12:02.705 --> 00:12:05.185
Especially the owner,

00:12:05.265 --> 00:12:07.025
very delicious.

00:12:14.585 --> 00:12:17.505
These are the four dishes
I'm planning to sell next month.

00:12:17.585 --> 00:12:20.705
You already finalized all four?

00:12:22.105 --> 00:12:24.185
I haven't even finished shooting them all.

00:12:25.385 --> 00:12:26.825
Just one left.

00:12:35.225 --> 00:12:36.625
Starting with the five-spice eggs.

00:12:44.065 --> 00:12:46.945
Remember when Aunt Aom
went looking for a job?

00:12:48.265 --> 00:12:50.505
She dropped you off at Aunt Tuk's

00:12:50.585 --> 00:12:52.105
so you'd have someone to play with,

00:12:52.185 --> 00:12:53.865
but you wouldn't eat anything.

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:08.465
Five-spice eggs
were the only thing you'd eat.

00:13:14.825 --> 00:13:16.305
And the mashed mackerel rice?

00:13:16.385 --> 00:13:20.025
When we went
on that school field trip to Amphawa,

00:13:20.105 --> 00:13:22.505
we shared one

00:13:22.585 --> 00:13:24.425
because our pocket money
was only enough for that.

00:13:29.345 --> 00:13:30.945
If you hadn't said it,

00:13:32.185 --> 00:13:34.225
I wouldn't even remember all that.

00:13:34.825 --> 00:13:39.025
And do you remember
where the crab-roe salad came from?

00:13:43.705 --> 00:13:45.425
When Auntie bought crabs,

00:13:45.505 --> 00:13:48.185
I'd eat only the roe
and give you all the meat, right?

00:13:48.265 --> 00:13:49.105
Exactly.

00:13:50.785 --> 00:13:54.785
After we eat, I'll have you
guess what the last dish is.

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:56.625
Okay.

00:13:58.385 --> 00:14:00.465
I'll take the crab roe.
Don't you dare steal it.

00:14:00.545 --> 00:14:01.665
Then I'm taking the meat.

00:14:05.385 --> 00:14:08.745
-You want the five-spice eggs first.
-Five-spice eggs.

00:14:08.825 --> 00:14:09.745
Yes.

00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:16.505
It's delicious, Jane.

00:14:17.825 --> 00:14:19.065
It fills my heart.

00:14:20.065 --> 00:14:21.345
Are you ready for dessert?

00:14:29.385 --> 00:14:31.305
-Hmm?
-I'll cover your eyes first.

00:14:32.625 --> 00:14:35.465
What dessert?
Why do I have to cover my eyes?

00:14:36.985 --> 00:14:39.465
Take my hand. I'll lead you there.

00:14:53.265 --> 00:14:54.585
Sit here.

00:14:54.665 --> 00:14:55.865
Alright.

00:14:58.545 --> 00:14:59.585
I'll be right back.

00:15:42.345 --> 00:15:43.505
What is it?

00:16:05.905 --> 00:16:07.185
Don't cry, okay?

00:16:31.305 --> 00:16:33.905
Why did you choose
coconut ice cream that day?

00:16:35.225 --> 00:16:36.825
Now that I think about it,

00:16:38.625 --> 00:16:40.745
that's not a flavor most kids would pick.

00:16:40.825 --> 00:16:43.825
We both loved chocolate back then,

00:16:44.985 --> 00:16:47.105
but Aunt Tuk kept
the chocolate flavor on the top shelf.

00:16:47.185 --> 00:16:48.265
She didn't want us to take it.

00:16:48.345 --> 00:16:51.705
I couldn't reach it.
I could only grab coconut.

00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:57.065
Back then, I just thought

00:16:57.145 --> 00:16:59.665
maybe ice cream
could make you feel better.

00:17:08.665 --> 00:17:09.704
Thank you.

00:17:10.464 --> 00:17:13.665
I'm the one who has to thank you

00:17:13.745 --> 00:17:15.105
for coming back to me.

00:17:20.985 --> 00:17:23.424
Every dish you made for me today…

00:17:26.905 --> 00:17:28.705
they're all about me.

00:17:33.185 --> 00:17:34.785
You've always inspired me.

00:17:37.465 --> 00:17:39.465
I wanted to cook for someone I love,

00:17:40.065 --> 00:17:41.905
to see her happy when she eats.

00:17:42.865 --> 00:17:45.665
I wanted to open a restaurant
with food so good,

00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:48.545
that one day, if you ever wanted
to eat at my restaurant,

00:17:49.865 --> 00:17:51.745
I would see you again.

00:20:15.065 --> 00:20:17.385
So the resort doesn't need a manager now?

00:20:20.065 --> 00:20:21.385
I want to try managing a restaurant.

00:20:21.465 --> 00:20:23.745
After all these years,
now you feel like working here?

00:20:30.305 --> 00:20:32.105
I was talking to the police
about the restaurant.

00:20:32.905 --> 00:20:33.985
Is something wrong?

00:20:39.065 --> 00:20:41.945
Jane, take a look at this.
I saved the clip for you.

00:20:45.265 --> 00:20:47.025
The police want to
talk to us about it too.

00:20:51.305 --> 00:20:54.385
I've got an interview.
I'll come back and check it out afterward.

00:20:55.505 --> 00:20:57.065
You? Going to an interview?

00:20:57.145 --> 00:21:00.025
Yeah, don't ask too much. Just go home.

00:21:05.945 --> 00:21:07.505
Well, Jane.

00:21:08.345 --> 00:21:09.585
Do you have any enemies?

00:21:11.305 --> 00:21:12.745
If I do, it's you.

00:21:13.825 --> 00:21:15.945
Hey, I'm serious.

00:21:19.105 --> 00:21:20.145
No, I don't.

00:21:24.425 --> 00:21:25.905
If it's not you,

00:21:27.465 --> 00:21:28.345
how about Lin?

00:21:34.105 --> 00:21:36.305
I'm asking because I'm worried.

00:21:36.985 --> 00:21:38.025
I know.

00:21:38.865 --> 00:21:40.785
Now go, I'm in a hurry.

00:21:50.185 --> 00:21:52.745
You should be happy
your kid turned out this good.

00:21:52.825 --> 00:21:54.945
Hardworking like this,
she'll never starve.

00:21:55.025 --> 00:21:59.105
Exactly, because she's good,
I want her to have a good life.

00:21:59.185 --> 00:22:02.185
Hey, I saw Lek the other day, right?

00:22:02.865 --> 00:22:03.745
Yeah.

00:22:03.825 --> 00:22:05.385
So what did he come back for?

00:22:06.025 --> 00:22:07.065
He was worried about us.

00:22:07.665 --> 00:22:10.225
What? After disappearing for 20 years,

00:22:10.305 --> 00:22:11.625
now he's worried?

00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:13.905
He said there's a rumor

00:22:13.985 --> 00:22:16.265
that Lin got fired
from her job in New York,

00:22:16.345 --> 00:22:19.305
and that she got an offer from W Magazine.

00:22:20.665 --> 00:22:22.705
He tried calling me,

00:22:22.785 --> 00:22:25.465
but I didn't pick up, so he came here.

00:22:27.905 --> 00:22:28.785
What's the truth then?

00:22:28.865 --> 00:22:31.025
Lin hasn't said anything.

00:22:31.105 --> 00:22:34.225
If she really got fired,
she would've told me, right?

00:22:34.305 --> 00:22:36.585
Of course. You're her mom.

00:22:37.745 --> 00:22:38.705
I think

00:22:38.785 --> 00:22:41.905
he's trying to worm his way
back into our lives.

00:22:41.985 --> 00:22:44.545
Lin's famous now.

00:22:44.625 --> 00:22:46.425
Everyone wants to work with her.

00:22:47.585 --> 00:22:50.825
He probably wants to show off
that she's his daughter.

00:22:51.785 --> 00:22:52.945
She's only your daughter.

00:22:53.945 --> 00:22:55.025
Now eat.

00:22:55.865 --> 00:22:58.865
The model wouldn't accept the job
unless it was you, Ms. Lin.

00:23:02.345 --> 00:23:03.505
Really?

00:23:03.585 --> 00:23:05.745
Yes. She's never given interviews before.

00:23:06.545 --> 00:23:08.745
The editor was thrilled
she agreed to this.

00:23:08.825 --> 00:23:11.585
They said they'd pay
whatever your rate is.

00:23:12.625 --> 00:23:13.665
Really?

00:23:15.225 --> 00:23:18.185
So I got the job because of the model?

00:23:21.905 --> 00:23:23.625
The model's heading to the set now.

00:23:23.705 --> 00:23:25.265
Alright, turn the lights on.

00:23:25.865 --> 00:23:27.385
Frank, lights on.

00:24:02.945 --> 00:24:04.225
Why are you doing this?

00:24:10.225 --> 00:24:11.585
We'll talk at home after this.

00:24:31.785 --> 00:24:34.065
Do you think I've fallen so low
that you had to do this?

00:24:34.785 --> 00:24:37.745
I don't like feeling that to you
I'm just an add-on.

00:24:40.465 --> 00:24:42.865
I want them to hire me for my skills,

00:24:42.945 --> 00:24:45.905
not because you wouldn't accept
the interview if it wasn't me.

00:24:49.825 --> 00:24:52.385
I'm sorry if I made you feel bad.

00:24:55.265 --> 00:24:57.025
Aren't you going to explain yourself?

00:24:58.745 --> 00:25:01.385
You were right. I was wrong

00:25:02.065 --> 00:25:03.825
to make you feel like an add-on.

00:25:03.905 --> 00:25:05.865
Then why did you do it?

00:25:05.945 --> 00:25:08.985
Because I wanted you
to feel confident in yourself.

00:25:09.585 --> 00:25:11.545
You don't need Pie.

00:25:11.625 --> 00:25:14.825
There are so many others
who want to work with you.

00:25:16.705 --> 00:25:20.785
Others who only want me because if
it's not me, you won't do the interview.

00:25:22.345 --> 00:25:23.305
Lin,

00:25:24.065 --> 00:25:26.145
do you know
why I never gave interviews before?

00:25:26.745 --> 00:25:27.625
Because you're arrogant?

00:25:28.545 --> 00:25:29.825
Because I'm shy.

00:25:29.905 --> 00:25:32.825
I'm not confident.
I never know how to act.

00:25:32.905 --> 00:25:35.065
I'm used to being in the kitchen.

00:25:35.145 --> 00:25:39.265
Suddenly standing there,
posing for pictures, it's not me.

00:25:39.985 --> 00:25:42.145
But you did great today.
No problem at all.

00:25:43.105 --> 00:25:44.785
That's because you were behind the camera.

00:25:50.345 --> 00:25:51.185
With you,

00:25:52.585 --> 00:25:53.865
I have something to focus on.

00:25:54.905 --> 00:25:58.025
I don't feel stiff.
I have a reason to smile at the camera

00:25:59.625 --> 00:26:01.425
because it feels like I'm smiling at you.

00:26:21.345 --> 00:26:22.305
I'm sorry…

00:26:24.185 --> 00:26:25.665
for the way I spoke to you.

00:26:28.545 --> 00:26:30.665
I should've been happy

00:26:31.385 --> 00:26:33.625
knowing that I mean that much to you.

00:26:39.465 --> 00:26:40.705
I'm sorry.

00:26:42.825 --> 00:26:43.985
It's okay.

00:26:47.665 --> 00:26:48.665
Alright.

00:26:48.745 --> 00:26:50.865
Come on.

00:26:53.025 --> 00:26:54.345
Auntie.

00:26:54.425 --> 00:26:56.745
Oh, Jane.

00:26:57.625 --> 00:26:59.865
Lin's dad came yesterday

00:26:59.945 --> 00:27:03.705
and told Aunt Aom there's a rumor
Lin lost her job,

00:27:03.785 --> 00:27:08.465
and now she's investing
in W Magazine. Is that true?

00:27:08.545 --> 00:27:09.665
It's true.

00:27:16.225 --> 00:27:17.265
Alright.

00:27:18.025 --> 00:27:19.425
Did she believe Dad?

00:27:20.665 --> 00:27:21.905
No, she didn't.

00:27:23.585 --> 00:27:26.385
I just didn't have the courage
to tell Mom. I didn't want to upset her.

00:27:27.785 --> 00:27:30.065
But I think you should tell her yourself.

00:27:30.145 --> 00:27:33.025
Better she hears it from you
than someone else.

00:27:39.945 --> 00:27:40.785
Yes, Mom.

00:27:43.785 --> 00:27:44.945
Yes.

00:27:46.785 --> 00:27:49.785
Mom said she's making hot pot tonight.
She asked me to invite you over.

00:27:52.945 --> 00:27:55.265
I'm so ready to eat.

00:28:08.465 --> 00:28:09.505
What's wrong?

00:28:11.265 --> 00:28:12.145
Lin,

00:28:12.825 --> 00:28:14.945
Kate dropped by.
She wants to have dinner with us.

00:28:44.985 --> 00:28:47.305
Lin, are you okay?

00:28:48.985 --> 00:28:50.825
I'm her daughter, Jane.

00:28:50.905 --> 00:28:52.385
Why isn't she on my side?

00:28:52.465 --> 00:28:55.025
She knows what Kate did to me.

00:28:57.585 --> 00:28:59.065
It's no big deal.

00:28:59.145 --> 00:29:02.345
She came. That's her business, not ours.

00:29:06.305 --> 00:29:07.465
Lin.

00:29:13.705 --> 00:29:15.425
Can I talk to you?

00:29:25.865 --> 00:29:26.705
Just the two of us.

00:29:37.865 --> 00:29:39.305
Why'd you invite her?

00:29:39.385 --> 00:29:41.145
You're afraid
we can't finish the food ourselves?

00:29:45.065 --> 00:29:46.185
I'm going home.

00:29:51.505 --> 00:29:52.665
What did Lin say?

00:29:56.705 --> 00:29:59.305
I don't think she'll ever forgive me.

00:30:06.665 --> 00:30:09.105
I don't want to talk.
I don't want to see her.

00:30:09.185 --> 00:30:10.865
I don't want to see Kate ever again.

00:30:14.705 --> 00:30:16.105
Do you still love her?

00:30:23.545 --> 00:30:24.385
No.

00:30:28.025 --> 00:30:29.745
Go get Lin for me.

00:30:30.785 --> 00:30:31.945
No.

00:30:32.025 --> 00:30:33.025
Aom.

00:30:33.905 --> 00:30:35.665
Let the kids handle it.

00:30:35.745 --> 00:30:37.225
Let me go.

00:30:38.385 --> 00:30:40.545
I'll let go if you don't go upstairs.

00:30:41.865 --> 00:30:44.705
Lin is my daughter. Why can't I go up?

00:30:44.785 --> 00:30:48.145
Because I said let the kids
solve it themselves.

00:30:49.745 --> 00:30:51.505
This is my family.

00:30:52.145 --> 00:30:53.665
But this is my house.

00:30:53.745 --> 00:30:55.945
I have every right to stop you
from going upstairs.

00:30:58.065 --> 00:30:59.345
Mom's definitely going to come up.

00:31:06.185 --> 00:31:07.145
Where's Mom?

00:31:07.225 --> 00:31:08.745
She already left.

00:31:10.345 --> 00:31:12.745
But I'm sure
she still wants to talk to you.

00:31:16.625 --> 00:31:18.465
She's not listening.

00:31:21.705 --> 00:31:22.545
Mom,

00:31:25.425 --> 00:31:27.385
come play with me.

00:31:29.265 --> 00:31:30.705
Mom, that hurts!

00:31:31.865 --> 00:31:33.025
Lin.

00:31:35.145 --> 00:31:36.545
Are you okay?

00:31:38.625 --> 00:31:41.305
Mom, I got first place on the exam.
Are you happy?

00:31:44.785 --> 00:31:45.985
Lin,

00:31:46.065 --> 00:31:47.905
why are you lying here?

00:31:51.505 --> 00:31:52.825
I was waiting for you.

00:31:54.665 --> 00:31:55.665
Why wait?

00:31:55.745 --> 00:32:00.185
You know I work late. You'll have to
wake up early for school tomorrow.

00:32:05.145 --> 00:32:06.825
I got a scholarship, Mom.

00:32:07.385 --> 00:32:08.865
I wanted to tell you first.

00:32:11.265 --> 00:32:13.025
A scholarship to New York?

00:32:16.265 --> 00:32:17.745
If I get a job,

00:32:17.825 --> 00:32:19.665
you won't have to work so hard anymore.

00:32:20.185 --> 00:32:21.425
I'll take care of you.

00:33:03.465 --> 00:33:04.625
Where's Lin?

00:33:05.305 --> 00:33:06.305
She's asleep.

00:33:11.185 --> 00:33:12.465
She was upset

00:33:14.185 --> 00:33:15.665
that Aunt Aom didn't take her side.

00:33:26.505 --> 00:33:27.945
And how about you?

00:33:44.545 --> 00:33:46.265
It's good to guard your heart sometimes.

00:34:17.784 --> 00:34:18.865
Jane…

00:34:28.304 --> 00:34:30.025
I'm going home to talk to my mom.

00:34:30.824 --> 00:34:32.065
Are you sure?

00:34:34.025 --> 00:34:35.304
I'm telling her about the job.

00:34:36.065 --> 00:34:37.545
Do you want me to come with you?

00:34:38.344 --> 00:34:39.585
It's okay.

00:34:40.304 --> 00:34:41.545
Talk to her gently, dear.

00:34:44.824 --> 00:34:46.065
-I will. Goodbye.
-Alright.

00:34:57.705 --> 00:34:58.865
Lin.

00:35:04.065 --> 00:35:05.585
I know you're angry at me.

00:35:06.465 --> 00:35:09.065
But when I heard the news, I got worried.

00:35:11.265 --> 00:35:12.145
I love you.

00:35:13.385 --> 00:35:14.545
About the job…

00:35:14.625 --> 00:35:17.065
If you loved her,
you wouldn't have left when she was five.

00:35:18.065 --> 00:35:19.265
Go back.

00:35:19.345 --> 00:35:21.705
Lin's more than capable
of taking care of herself,

00:35:21.785 --> 00:35:25.345
and me, her only real family.

00:35:25.425 --> 00:35:26.865
You're an outsider.

00:35:26.945 --> 00:35:30.785
You have no right to meddle
in this family, and no right

00:35:30.865 --> 00:35:33.465
to give advice
to someone you didn't raise.

00:35:34.065 --> 00:35:36.265
Lin is my child, not yours.

00:35:36.985 --> 00:35:38.945
Go home, and don't ever come back.

00:35:39.025 --> 00:35:40.425
Or I'll call the police.

00:35:42.625 --> 00:35:44.225
Lin, go inside.

00:36:09.105 --> 00:36:10.465
Eat with me, please.

00:37:31.345 --> 00:37:32.545
Mom…

00:37:41.625 --> 00:37:43.025
I got fired.

00:37:51.705 --> 00:37:53.825
Mom, please listen.

00:38:03.825 --> 00:38:06.185
Why didn't you tell me from the start?

00:38:07.825 --> 00:38:10.825
I didn't believe your dad when he said it.

00:38:13.945 --> 00:38:16.065
But then I heard it from Kate yesterday.

00:38:17.465 --> 00:38:19.705
I was afraid you'd be disappointed

00:38:21.305 --> 00:38:23.785
that I failed

00:38:25.345 --> 00:38:28.025
to live up to your hopes.

00:38:37.425 --> 00:38:39.985
I've never been disappointed in you.

00:38:41.065 --> 00:38:43.225
No matter what happens,

00:38:43.305 --> 00:38:46.785
you're the greatest pride of my life.

00:39:09.465 --> 00:39:11.225
Send it to the client first.

00:39:11.825 --> 00:39:12.865
Yes, ma'am.

00:39:14.945 --> 00:39:17.265
You can't come in. Please wait outside.

00:39:17.345 --> 00:39:20.545
You're the one who should be
waiting outside. I need to speak with Pie.

00:39:20.625 --> 00:39:21.785
-You're not allowed.
-It's fine.

00:39:22.665 --> 00:39:24.225
Go back to work.

00:39:31.305 --> 00:39:33.665
If it's urgent, you could've just called.

00:39:33.745 --> 00:39:36.905
I just wanted to see the face
of someone respected in society

00:39:37.705 --> 00:39:39.825
who acts like a criminal.

00:39:41.345 --> 00:39:43.585
That's defamation, unless you have proof.

00:40:04.425 --> 00:40:05.585
I'm sorry.

00:40:11.545 --> 00:40:13.705
Your staff who hit me with a car

00:40:13.785 --> 00:40:15.505
threw rocks at my restaurant.

00:40:18.265 --> 00:40:19.985
How is that related to me?

00:40:21.625 --> 00:40:22.665
Besides,

00:40:22.745 --> 00:40:26.265
I fired him the same day
he grazed you on set.

00:40:28.825 --> 00:40:31.265
He caused trouble,
he had to take responsibility.

00:40:32.185 --> 00:40:34.145
You really think I ordered him to do it?

00:40:36.065 --> 00:40:37.225
I was sitting there too.

00:40:38.665 --> 00:40:40.745
I could've been hit by glass or rocks.

00:40:40.825 --> 00:40:41.825
And what about Uncle Lek?

00:40:42.945 --> 00:40:44.665
How do you explain that?

00:40:47.905 --> 00:40:50.545
I know, but she wouldn't listen.

00:40:50.625 --> 00:40:53.585
Ms. Pie, you still have to pay me.

00:40:53.665 --> 00:40:54.905
I delivered the message.

00:40:54.985 --> 00:40:57.265
But I never said how she'd react.

00:41:04.905 --> 00:41:06.305
Stay away from Lin,

00:41:06.385 --> 00:41:08.705
no matter
if it's about work or investments.

00:41:10.465 --> 00:41:12.945
Or I'll testify
where all of this really came from.

00:41:14.745 --> 00:41:17.585
If your staff or Uncle Lek
claims you hired them,

00:41:18.185 --> 00:41:19.545
you won't get away with it.

00:41:48.705 --> 00:41:51.065
I was wondering how you managed

00:41:51.145 --> 00:41:53.785
to stay home for so long.

00:41:56.625 --> 00:41:59.305
And about Kate, what do you think?

00:42:02.665 --> 00:42:03.665
Mom…

00:42:06.105 --> 00:42:09.985
I know she hurt you.

00:42:10.065 --> 00:42:12.545
If I were you, I'd be angry too.

00:42:14.545 --> 00:42:16.825
But if she wants to apologize,

00:42:17.745 --> 00:42:19.745
you should at least let her talk.

00:42:21.585 --> 00:42:22.705
Listen first,

00:42:23.305 --> 00:42:25.465
then decide.

00:42:35.865 --> 00:42:38.345
Here, call her.

00:42:38.425 --> 00:42:40.225
She's probably waiting.

00:42:45.185 --> 00:42:47.185
Don't go out alone like that again.

00:42:47.265 --> 00:42:51.145
If she can hire someone to throw rocks,
what if something worse happens?

00:42:51.225 --> 00:42:54.065
I know, but I couldn't hold it in.

00:43:03.345 --> 00:43:04.985
Now I get why Dad came back.

00:43:07.385 --> 00:43:08.945
He still wants money from Mom and me.

00:43:13.665 --> 00:43:16.265
Let them go, both your dad and Pie.

00:43:21.945 --> 00:43:24.625
I might be unemployed for a while.

00:43:28.025 --> 00:43:30.225
You're so talented.
You won't be jobless for long.

00:43:31.505 --> 00:43:32.505
It's already been a while.

00:43:33.465 --> 00:43:36.385
Just think of it as a break.
Spend time with me.

00:43:46.385 --> 00:43:47.545
As for Kate,

00:43:47.625 --> 00:43:49.705
maybe just call her and get it over with.

00:43:50.465 --> 00:43:51.665
Are you okay with that?

00:43:51.745 --> 00:43:54.265
Of course. Why not?

00:43:56.265 --> 00:43:57.185
Not jealous?

00:43:58.825 --> 00:44:02.465
Not jealous, because you're mine.

00:44:07.945 --> 00:44:09.185
Thank you.

00:44:32.305 --> 00:44:33.145
Lin.

00:44:37.265 --> 00:44:39.305
-Want a drink?
-No.

00:44:40.505 --> 00:44:41.945
Let's just talk so I can go home.

00:44:43.105 --> 00:44:46.625
So you came just to get this over with?

00:44:47.465 --> 00:44:48.385
Yes.

00:45:04.185 --> 00:45:05.785
I'm sorry.

00:45:11.585 --> 00:45:14.865
I've never had the chance
to say it since that day.

00:45:18.105 --> 00:45:20.065
You don't have to.

00:45:20.145 --> 00:45:22.345
We don't even have to see
each other again. I don't mind.

00:45:32.465 --> 00:45:33.345
Lin.

00:45:35.305 --> 00:45:37.345
Tan tricked me.

00:45:41.705 --> 00:45:43.305
So that's all you came to say?

00:45:44.745 --> 00:45:45.985
Lin.

00:45:48.065 --> 00:45:49.625
Please, just hear me out.

00:45:57.065 --> 00:45:59.385
The guys at your office were betting

00:46:00.665 --> 00:46:04.225
on whether someone could come between us.

00:46:18.465 --> 00:46:20.465
I'm so sorry.

00:46:21.865 --> 00:46:24.545
If I could turn back time,
I'd never do it.

00:46:28.225 --> 00:46:30.385
I'll do anything,

00:46:31.185 --> 00:46:35.065
just give us another chance.

00:46:37.465 --> 00:46:40.305
I promise it'll never happen again.

00:46:48.545 --> 00:46:50.585
I still love you, darling.

00:46:55.745 --> 00:46:56.825
Hello.

00:46:57.545 --> 00:46:58.865
Do you know Lin?

00:47:00.785 --> 00:47:03.185
You should be with me, not Jane.

00:47:04.385 --> 00:47:07.465
Lin is my girlfriend, not yours.

00:47:09.385 --> 00:47:10.745
The ring you're wearing,

00:47:10.825 --> 00:47:12.305
I have one too.

00:47:13.305 --> 00:47:15.625
How do you know
she loves you more than me?

00:47:18.905 --> 00:47:19.865
Jane.

00:47:20.825 --> 00:47:21.825
Jane.

00:47:22.585 --> 00:47:25.625
If that's how it is,
why not give me a chance instead?

00:47:51.705 --> 00:47:54.105
