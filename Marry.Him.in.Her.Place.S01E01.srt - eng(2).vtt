(Xiao Mudan)
Move faster!

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.139
(Madam of Huaying Brothel)
I'll have your heads if you can't find her!

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.340
Yes, ma'am.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.080
Xiao Mudan's at it again.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.499
I've lost count of how many times
it's happened this month.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.179
Get on with it.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.659
Did you forget how Li died?

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.979
If she hears you,

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.700
she'll skin you alive.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.179
Xu Yin always looks timid, but the moment
she had to keep Liu Kui company,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.819
she threw herself into the river.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.859
If she ends up dead,
I'll have no way to answer to Mr. Kui.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.859
Can't blame her.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.659
No woman who stayed
with Liu Kui ever survived.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.760
- Their deaths were horrific.
- Shut that trap of yours.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.220
What good are you
if you won't keep my customers happy?

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.059
That's right.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.499
Enough.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.180
We've found her!

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.579
What are you waiting for?

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.980
Pull her out!

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.460
Why are there two?

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.500
- Why are there two women?
- Indeed.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.940
Playing dead?

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.339
Get up!

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.260
We took Mr. Kui's money.
Don't you dare die on me!

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.720
Maybe we should return it.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.699
You think he cares
about that pocket change?

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.800
If we can't hand her over,
Huaying Brothel's finished.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.059
Keep your mouths shut

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.420
or you won't live through today.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.620
What a perfect body.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.499
Oh, Xu Yin,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.859
did you think dying would free you?

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.900
All I ever needed was your face.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.580
(Three months later)

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.940
Oh, Xu Yin.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.299
Surprised?

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.580
Your face is alive again.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.300
It's flawless.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.860
It's as if
it was carved from the same mold.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.259
From this moment on,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.140
you're Xu Yin.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.779
Win Mr. Kui over

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.139
and I'll treat you like my own daughter.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.940
You'll want for nothing.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.499
You turned me into this.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.860
Aren't you afraid of retribution?

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.340
Retribution?

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.739
Don't forget.
You were a disfigured wreck

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.380
when I found you.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.219
I found the best doctor in the city,

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.179
and I gave you that beautiful face.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.139
You should be grateful.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.259
Never!

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.459
I'd rather die than let you control me.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.819
I see you won't behave
until you're staring death in the face.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.019
The only reason you're alive
is to serve Mr. Kui.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.260
One mistake,

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.260
and I'll make sure you wish
you were dead.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.260
(Liu Kui, the Tyrant of Rong City)
I've waited so long for you.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.940
I'm dying of impatience here.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.579
I heard you jumped
into the river just to avoid me.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.820
I like that fire in you.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.379
Please me tonight

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.259
and maybe I'll buy your freedom,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.860
make you one of my concubines.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.659
Don't touch me!

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.260
Unhand me!

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.020
You asked for it!

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.460
You little wretch, I'll kill you!

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.459
Drag that brat over here!

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.540
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.820
Ungrateful wench.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.060
Mr. Kui's one of our biggest clients.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.299
He wants an explanation
from Huaying Brothel.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.059
Since you caused the mess,

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.300
you'll clean it up.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.659
Throw her in and lock it.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.220
Send her to him as compensation.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.379
Help!

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.660
Let me out!

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.939
Here, I'm the one you answer to.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.619
Oppose me,

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.259
and you won't survive.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.620
Is that clear?

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.700
Help!

00:06:42.396 --> 00:06:44.100
Stop!

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.140
(Lin Yun, Head of Chengyun Society)

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.740
Who are you?

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.139
(I didn't expect the first person
to ask who I am)

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.419
(to be you,)

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.860
(Lin Yun.)

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.779
(My face was destroyed,)

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.059
(my name taken.)

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.859
(Everything that happened)

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.139
(started with that wedding)

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.020
(built on lies and deceit.)

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.180
(On the day of the wedding)

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.099
(Song Zhichu, Police Chief of Rong City)

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.259
The groom is here.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.619
(Liang Residence)
Are the lotus seeds ready? The lilies?

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.899
Is the front hall all set up?

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.459
Miss Liang,
stop worrying about all that.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.838
(Liang Yi)
You just need to be

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:52.219
(Only daughter of the Liang family)
the most beautiful bride today.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.179
(Ruyi, Maid of the Liang family)
You're so eager to get married.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.579
Silly girl.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.620
Once you fall for someone,
you'll understand.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.139
Song Zhichu is the police chief.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.080
His father, Song Ming, is the mayor.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.619
Now, he's marrying the daughter
of Rong City's richest man.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.259
The Song family's practically
becoming royalty.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.019
You mean Liang Wenbin
is so desperate to climb the ladder

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.500
(Liang Wenbin, Richest Man in Rong City)
that he'd even sell his daughter?

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:18.900
Mind your tongue!

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.779
I love Miss Liang
from the bottom of my heart

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.419
and I'm earnest about this marriage.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.579
No one has the right

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.380
to doubt my love for her.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.259
Today's my wedding,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.620
so I'll let that slide.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.300
Father.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:47.980
Let's go.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.140
The auspicious hour has arrived.

00:09:02.777 --> 00:09:06.220
(Song Ming, Mayor of Rong City)

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.700
Let's go over there.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.099
Mr. Li, it's an honor

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.299
to have you here.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:16.859
Thank you.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:17.780
Congratulations.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.659
Isn't that Lin Yun,
the man who runs the underworld here?

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.739
What's he doing here?

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.220
Is he here to cause a scene?

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.420
You didn't even clean
the blood on your hands.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.460
Lin Yun,
you strut in as if you own the place.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.580
(Deed)
I wouldn't have come without this.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.859
Since when has
the Liang family's wedding

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.420
allowed just anyone to wander in?

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.340
Zhichu.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.259
You're right, Father.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.459
But today's a joyous occasion.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.900
Guests are guests.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.059
Liang, let the younger ones

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.579
handle their own business.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.580
Have a drink with me.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.860
He's an old stick. Ignore him.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.219
Father.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.019
Mr. Song.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.980
Sit. I'll go check on Master Liang.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.960
The deal with Mr. Li is taken care of.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.379
Quanwan is ours now.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.140
It's only the beginning.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.699
Soon, all of Rong City will be ours.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.939
Let me introduce someone.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.940
Liang Yi.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.179
Let me introduce you.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.899
My best friend, Lin Yun.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.100
My wife-to-be, Liang Yi.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.820
(Happiness)

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.020
Zhichu...

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.460
Zhichu...

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.060
Zhichu...

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.060
Zhichu...

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.819
It's you?

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.259
Think about it.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.459
If Song Zhichu hadn't arranged this,

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.579
how would I be here?

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:15.579
This can't be true...

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.699
Wake up. Remember this.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.700
Not a single man

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.020
in this world is trustworthy.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.860
Take this knife
as my wedding gift to you.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.580
Song Zhichu,

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.900
how could you do this to me?

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.020
Father...

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.140
Father...

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.460
Father!

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.179
I had no intentions of killing you,

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.020
but you showed up here.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.820
You're awake.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.340
Song Zhichu.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.259
Where's my father?

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.739
You saw it yourself, didn't you?

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.060
He's dead.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.099
Song Zhichu,

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.980
what did the Liang family
ever do to you?

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.180
The Liang family?

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.459
You think the Liang family's

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.019
high status

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.699
is something special?

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.419
I approached you

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.780
and courted you

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.780
for one reason, your family fortune.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.179
What you thought was love

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.500
was a scheme I planned from the start.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.860
That's my wife-to-be.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.379
You're my friend.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.540
You'll bed her for me tonight.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.939
Your father thought he was righteous.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.539
So I found the one man he despised most

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.859
to ruin his precious daughter.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:33.699
Well?

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.260
Doesn't like make a fine plot?

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.260
I can have any woman I want.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.020
But you?

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.699
Acting like a princess,
barking orders at me every day.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.300
You make me sick!

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.300
So...

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.340
You handed me over to another man

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.419
just to disgrace me?

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.459
You even killed my father?

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.339
All these years,

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.379
I've flattered you

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.939
and done everything you wanted,

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.299
waiting for this moment

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.620
to take full control
of the Liang family.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.700
You're a demon!

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.340
You'll pay for this!

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.779
You're too noisy.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.260
You and your father were nothing
but pieces on a board.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.499
Goodbye,

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.380
my bride.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.379
The finest mask in this world

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.499
(Liang Yi)
is a living face.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.219
(Xu Yin)
To everyone, I'm Xu Yin.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.459
But I'm also Liang Yi,
the woman who crawled back

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.299
from the abyss.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.100
Who are you?

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.579
Lin Yun,

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.619
it's me, Xu Yin.
