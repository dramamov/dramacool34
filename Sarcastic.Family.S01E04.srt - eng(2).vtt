00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.799
So adorable.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:51.439
So cute.

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:52.400
Look, chubby like Dudu.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.840
Really, really.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.640
How much does he weigh now?

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:55.959
Ten, eleven jin.

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:58.040
His little hands look like buns.

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:59.640
That face is so round and chubby.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.519
Makes you want to pinch it.

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:01.359
Want to squeeze that little face.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.480
Yeah, me too.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.400
What? What?

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.040
Look quickly.

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:05.840
Isn't it cute?

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:08.599
Isn't it fun?

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.280
Sorry about that.

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:18.400
Your phone is pretty waterproof.

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:20.400
Cute, right?

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:29.000
What are you looking for?

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.599
Me.

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.479
I brought that doll home yesterday.

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:33.520
I left it on the sofa.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.199
Did you see it?

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.520
I put it away.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.080
It's too scary for me.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.919
What?

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.719
Those sky-blue big eyes.

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:43.879
Fuzzy little ears.

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.120
Fluffy, curled tail.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.159
You.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.360
You call that scary, not cute.

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.719
Whenever I see things like that,

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:54.280
I feel uncomfortable all over.

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.439
I'm allergic to that cu—

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.879
Cu— cu—

00:02:57.919 --> 00:02:58.680
Cu— cute.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.759
Allergic.

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:01.840
Really?

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.479
That's so unlucky for you.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.080
You're not allergic, right?

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.159
You're not cu—

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.360
te, either.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.120
This won't do, this one—

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.960
No, this won't work.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.159
This one is truly cute.

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.759
I really can't handle it.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.960
Sorry.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.199
Sorry.

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:27.240
This one really doesn't work.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.840
I'm really allergic.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.840
Please, take it away.

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:34.759
Where I used to live,

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.400
there weren't so many allergens.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.520
I never thought my allergy was this bad.

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:40.120
Alright, I'll be careful next time.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.599
From now on.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.719
Hurry, hurry.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.520
I won't tease you like this.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.000
Alright.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.400
But I—

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.400
Can't go on like this forever.

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.479
Can you help me find a way?

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.159
How can I get over it?

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:52.199
How about this—

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.960
Start by saying those two words.

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.960
Okay?

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:00.439
When you have to say them,

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.159
think of a lyric in your head

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.080
that uses those two words.

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:09.319
Cu—

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.960
It's a pity it's not you.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.319
Love even if I die—

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.879
Love.

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.319
Why are you singing it?

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.160
When are you and Meng Hang having the wedding?

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:22.399
Not having one.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.560
I think it's pointless.

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:25.240
At least on this point,

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.519
Mengmeng and I totally agree.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.319
I really want a wedding.

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:32.639
Look at this leg.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.120
No—

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.279
How about this girl?

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.240
You're not good enough for her.

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:40.439
Honestly—

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.720
Since elementary school,

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:43.959
I've wanted to have

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:45.800
a touching, dreamy wedding.

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:49.439
That's a romantic idea.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.079
When my dad was young,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.240
he often played music at weddings.

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:55.399
He always took me along.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.279
You must've eaten a lot of good food.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.480
I witnessed many love stories.

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.759
But I wasn't impressed by the grooms.

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:03.600
None of them satisfied me.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.079
Each one—

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:06.399
Looked dull and lifeless.

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.399
Like walking corpses.

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:09.800
That's normal.

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:12.079
Grooms are just props anyway.

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:14.199
But it's a bad experience for the bride.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.879
I vowed

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:18.000
to be the perfect groom.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.680
Put my heart into every part.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.040
And finally, with the bride,

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.560
make a solemn lifelong promise.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.399
Got it.

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:28.639
You want to do it in front of everyone,

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:31.240
and make the biggest promise to Lili.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.040
Right?

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:34.120
Just tell her directly.

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:37.879
Lili clearly said before

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.480
she doesn't want a wedding.

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.120
But I went along with her

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:42.399
and acted

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:44.399
like I didn't care.

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:47.360
This one's really good.

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:49.920
Even though she's fifty-nine,

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:51.720
I'm fine with older women.

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:55.680
Can you stop treating client info

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.040
like a dating app?

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.920
No—

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.639
I genuinely want to know

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:01.839
these outstanding women.

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:02.680
Especially

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:05.519
those with high budgets for buying homes.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.560
Do you have a client

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:11.600
Ms. Niu?

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.399
Is she really rich?

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.279
She invites you for lunch,

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:16.839
not to be a freeloader.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.160
Freeloading doesn't hurt your stomach.

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:19.759
Forget about Ms. Niu.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.240
She's buying a wedding home for herself.

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:25.319
A wedding home is great.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.800
I'd just move in with my bag.

00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:28.800
Tell me—

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:29.560
Is she remarried,

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.600
or marrying late?

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:34.240
Client privacy.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.360
You're stingy.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.199
Maybe you could discuss with the mother-in-law

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:42.759
about the wedding.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.639
Wait—

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.759
I haven't dropped the real estate tycoon act yet.

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:50.680
But—

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.480
Mother-in-law seems sharp and generous.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.160
She's definitely not money-minded.

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:02.040
Where's the money hidden?

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:47.120
Please answer the Heaven and Earth Bank call.

00:07:47.439 --> 00:07:48.800
Heaven and Earth—are you out of your mind?

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.120
This...

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.879
What kind of manners is that?

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.879
The next ship to Earth is in half a year.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.439
Alright.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.199
Then I'll just put up with it.

00:08:04.439 --> 00:08:05.360
I'll tolerate you for another half year.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.240
The only real problem is—

00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:09.480
The landing site is at the South Pole.

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:11.800
Wear more clothes when you take me there.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.000
After all, we're mother and daughter.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.920
I'll try to see you off at the stairs.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.399
No need.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.680
I'm already at the South Pole.

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:20.319
My heart feels so cold.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.519
Oh, give me a break.

00:08:21.519 --> 00:08:22.519
You don't even have a heart.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.040
Then just get the money ready.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.879
Going to the South Pole isn't cheap.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.120
Oh, come on.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.040
Where would I get the money?

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.439
Lili has a job on home planet Earth.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.960
She earns double salaries.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.279
She must be hiding all her money.

00:08:36.639 --> 00:08:38.039
At least five hundred thousand.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.279
Not a cent less.

00:08:46.799 --> 00:08:47.720
Hello, boss lady.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.879
Lili, come here.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.000
The boss is flying to Shanghai soon.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.120
I need you, understand?

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:55.759
Got it.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.279
Shanghai—the city that never sleeps.

00:08:57.279 --> 00:08:58.320
He can't go alone for sure.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.120
I'm heading out right away.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:08:59.679
No need.

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:00.879
I'm going to the meeting myself this time.

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:02.039
So what should I do then?

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.279
Help me look after Sabrina.

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:03.879
Understand?

00:09:03.879 --> 00:09:04.720
Sabrina what?

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:06.080
Sabrina.

00:09:09.919 --> 00:09:10.600
Isn't she cute?

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.440
I just bought her from the kennel—royal bloodline.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:13.720
No way, sis.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.559
I'm allergic.

00:09:14.759 --> 00:09:16.919
Maybe get that intern Coco or someone.

00:09:17.919 --> 00:09:19.000
She's just like my husband.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.320
I only trust you with her.

00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:23.360
Sis, your documents.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.320
Puppy.

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:29.759
So cute.

00:09:29.879 --> 00:09:30.360
Stop!

00:09:31.799 --> 00:09:32.559
You can't touch her.

00:09:33.879 --> 00:09:34.840
Also, change your clothes.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.480
You two are wearing the same thing.

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:14.080
Old fox.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.759
On the tenth, use card A to pay card B.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.200
On the twentieth, use card B to pay card C.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.360
On the thirtieth, use card C to pay card A.

00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:29.159
Credit card cash-out.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.200
Such a deadbeat.

00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:38.240
This pet shop—

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.600
This pet shop must have hidden cash.

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:58.679
So cute!

00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:10.679
What are you doing?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.639
Me...

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:14.159
That's disgusting.

00:11:14.159 --> 00:11:15.480
Take it away, take it away, take it away!

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.720
Don't scare her.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.799
She peed herself.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.120
Look what you've done.

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:20.279
What—what do we do with this?

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:21.360
What do we do with this?

00:11:21.399 --> 00:11:22.360
Hurry up, hurry up!

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:23.159
Get in the cage.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.759
I can't get in either.

00:11:28.919 --> 00:11:30.360
No, who told you to get in the cage?

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.240
She went in—she's in.

00:11:33.399 --> 00:11:34.799
But it's locked.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:35.919
Hurry up.

00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:37.440
I allow you to use your superpower.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.360
Teleport her inside.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:38.720
Quick!

00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:39.399
No...

00:11:40.159 --> 00:11:41.279
Forget superpowers—

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:42.600
I'm totally weak right now.

00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:44.399
No superpower.

00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:45.480
You do it.

00:11:45.759 --> 00:11:46.720
Whenever it's critical—

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.000
I can't count on you for anything.

00:11:48.759 --> 00:11:49.440
Fine, I'll do it.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:49.960
Hurry up.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.360
I can overcome difficulties.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.639
I got this.

00:11:53.639 --> 00:11:54.159
Three.

00:11:54.799 --> 00:11:55.320
Two.

00:11:55.559 --> 00:11:56.080
One.

00:11:59.799 --> 00:12:01.080
Let the difficulty be overcome.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.080
Don't fight with difficulties.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.399
If you can't win, just dodge.

00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:09.080
Alright.

00:12:09.799 --> 00:12:10.960
I'm heading back to work.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.840
Keep an eye on things here.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.039
Meng Hang's dad will be back soon.

00:12:13.039 --> 00:12:13.879
Let him know.

00:12:15.559 --> 00:12:16.879
Little Meng is busy all day long.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.279
Where does he work?

00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:21.559
His...

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.320
His business is very broad.

00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:24.080
Darn it.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.200
He works in lots of places.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.919
I don't know where he is today.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:27.679
I'm leaving now.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.360
So flustered.

00:12:29.679 --> 00:12:31.679
Just afraid I'll ask Meng for money.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.279
You really think I don't know where he is?

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.559
Old Gao, you carry the load.

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:41.080
Old Gao, you lead the horse.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.200
You're so unserious.

00:12:43.159 --> 00:12:44.679
My eldest granddaughter—

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.399
She insists on having a pet.

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:47.879
What's the cheapest thing here?

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.279
Your affection is the cheapest.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.279
So stingy.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.519
My door wasn't locked.

00:12:55.879 --> 00:12:56.840
My memory...

00:12:56.879 --> 00:12:58.000
You're getting senile.

00:12:58.519 --> 00:12:58.919
Come, come, come.

00:12:58.919 --> 00:12:59.720
Come in, come in, come in.

00:13:01.799 --> 00:13:02.279
This one.

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:03.799
Expensive.

00:13:04.919 --> 00:13:05.879
Chang'e held it once.

00:13:06.759 --> 00:13:07.240
This one.

00:13:07.799 --> 00:13:09.159
Purebred Dutch Lop Rabbit.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.440
Market price is one thousand.

00:13:10.759 --> 00:13:11.600
You're family.

00:13:11.679 --> 00:13:12.600
Six hundred—take it.

00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:13.200
Fifty.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:13.960
Shameless.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.080
You're the shameless one.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.759
I went with you to the flower and bird market—

00:13:16.759 --> 00:13:17.639
to bring it back.

00:13:17.919 --> 00:13:19.399
It was fifty when we bought it.

00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:20.519
Who are you trying to fool?

00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:22.759
I even paid for the travel.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.480
Seriously...

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.200
I told you, my memory...

00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:27.559
You...

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:37.759
This

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.039
Who is it?

00:13:42.279 --> 00:13:43.639
Abandoned again?

00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:45.759
Are they treating my place
like a shelter?

00:13:45.759 --> 00:13:46.720
Darn it.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.840
Even chewed up my camera cable.

00:13:49.879 --> 00:13:50.320
Anyway,

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.000
You never plug it in
to save power.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.320
This...

00:13:55.679 --> 00:13:56.080
Old Gao.

00:13:56.519 --> 00:13:58.559
You can give this to
your granddaughter.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.600
Let her keep it as a pet.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.080
This one looks so gloomy.

00:14:01.639 --> 00:14:02.879
Is this free?

00:14:03.159 --> 00:14:04.399
You should've said so earlier.

00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:05.360
Go to Dad.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.519
Free is good.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.000
Who is this?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.399
This is such a mess.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.240
Such a shabby little place.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:28.759
Hello.

00:14:29.919 --> 00:14:31.039
Judging by your looks,

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.639
I should call you "sis," right?

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:33.720
So, what's up?

00:14:33.919 --> 00:14:35.600
Buying or selling, sis?

00:14:36.039 --> 00:14:37.399
Bro, you're kind of a jerk.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.080
How did you know my surname is Cha?

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.759
Tell your boss

00:14:41.759 --> 00:14:42.759
his mother-in-law is here.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.240
Manager.

00:14:53.919 --> 00:14:54.919
Your mother-in-law is here.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.559
My father-in-law had a stroke.

00:14:58.559 --> 00:14:59.480
He can still get married again?

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.720
Here she comes.

00:15:06.519 --> 00:15:07.159
Wife,

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.919
When did your dad start dating
an older beauty?

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.200
What nonsense!

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.000
Are you out of your mind?

00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:16.159
No,

00:15:16.919 --> 00:15:19.360
If I cheat, Dad would never cheat.

00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:20.000
No.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.240
I—I—I didn't cheat!

00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:22.000
Let me explain.

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:30.759
Whose mother-in-law are you?

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.120
Who are you?

00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:35.000
My son-in-law's photo

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.919
is stuck on the glass.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.440
Is she President Meng's
mother-in-law?

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:48.519
Are you President Meng's...

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.320
What do you think?

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.360
Auntie,

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.519
Why did you come in person
to check on us?

00:15:55.639 --> 00:15:56.559
Please, come in.

00:15:56.919 --> 00:15:57.399
Come in.

00:15:58.919 --> 00:16:00.039
Please, please, please.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.399
Feel free to look around.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:08.720
Where is he?

00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:09.919
Please wait a moment.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.080
I'll find him right away.

00:16:12.159 --> 00:16:13.440
Give me the address later.

00:16:13.879 --> 00:16:14.559
I'll go find him.

00:16:15.799 --> 00:16:16.480
Have some tea.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:20.840
It's too hot.

00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:30.600
Darn it, I...

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.120
I...

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.039
I'll show you the house.

00:16:32.039 --> 00:16:32.759
Even made you drive.

00:16:32.759 --> 00:16:33.679
I'm really sorry.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.000
Your job is pretty tough.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.120
We're all just workers.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:37.759
Can't help it.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:38.919
Sometimes,

00:16:38.919 --> 00:16:41.080
I really want to quit and
farm in the countryside.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.039
Farming?

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.679
Farming means early mornings
and late nights.

00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:45.879
It's about the same as working.

00:16:46.679 --> 00:16:47.919
At least crops won't

00:16:47.919 --> 00:16:49.639
call and yell at me
at eleven at night.

00:16:50.519 --> 00:16:51.679
All capitalists are the same.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.759
Ugly faces.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.120
What kind of junk did you make?

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:55.759
I'm telling you,

00:16:55.759 --> 00:16:57.080
before midnight,

00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:58.600
redo it for me.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.240
Keep your phone on
and wait for my call.

00:17:04.279 --> 00:17:04.799
House viewing.

00:17:05.519 --> 00:17:06.400
Let's go see the house.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:16.759
Ms. Niu, this way please.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.200
Watch your step.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:30.880
Come in, come in.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.400
The gate of this complex
is impressive.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.440
Not bad, not bad.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:38.440
Wait.

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:40.559
I—I—I'll take

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:41.440
some photos.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:41.960
Okay.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.920
Let me tell you, Huanyu,

00:18:14.079 --> 00:18:15.440
I'm at the new house now.

00:18:15.599 --> 00:18:16.599
Hang in there, Meng Hang.

00:18:17.279 --> 00:18:18.279
I can't say it right now.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.400
This is such a pain.

00:18:21.079 --> 00:18:23.000
I'm just not cut out for lying.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.960
Mom is driving me crazy.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.640
I was born to

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.599
lie.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.279
After staying on Earth so long,

00:18:30.279 --> 00:18:31.960
my mind reading is getting rusty.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.039
It's all patchy now.

00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:36.640
If Mom sees I'm hiding something,

00:18:37.319 --> 00:18:37.880
she'll

00:18:38.359 --> 00:18:39.039
find

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.119
out.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.079
She'd totally destroy me.

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:44.440
I'll talk to Lili about it later.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.480
She'd finish

00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:47.759
Lili

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.960
off. Never mind.

00:18:49.599 --> 00:18:50.880
Darn it.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.720
Cheating is one thing,

00:18:52.759 --> 00:18:55.160
but why am I thinking about Lili's funeral?

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.119
Uh...

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.000
Uh, uh, uh...

00:18:57.039 --> 00:18:57.640
Go that way.

00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:01.920
I can't hear you now.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.279
It's fine.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.119
The best investigations

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.440
often use the simplest methods.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:10.880
Meng Hang,

00:19:11.799 --> 00:19:12.720
give me a hand, will you?

00:19:12.759 --> 00:19:13.400
Take it slow.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.519
These stairs are way too steep.

00:19:15.559 --> 00:19:16.640
Is there no elevator here?

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.720
No elevator, that's right.

00:19:18.839 --> 00:19:19.880
It's only two floors.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.079
No need for an elevator.

00:19:23.799 --> 00:19:25.480
The decor is pretty nice.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.720
This cost quite a bit.

00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:28.720
There's some taste to it.

00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:29.559
Yeah.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.160
See, even though it's a basement,

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.839
the lighting isn't affected at all.

00:19:34.839 --> 00:19:35.480
This place

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.440
is 240 square meters total.

00:19:37.559 --> 00:19:39.079
The upper floor is 120 square meters.

00:19:39.079 --> 00:19:39.920
The lower level

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.920
is actually a bonus.

00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:42.240
It's quite a good deal.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.680
The owner has always

00:19:43.839 --> 00:19:44.359
been away.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.880
I think it's perfect for your new home.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.160
It's pretty suitable.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.440
What do you think?

00:19:48.759 --> 00:19:50.119
I'm still hesitating.

00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:53.640
No worries.

00:19:54.119 --> 00:19:55.759
There are more places to see next.

00:19:56.119 --> 00:19:57.039
When picking a house,

00:19:57.039 --> 00:19:58.519
you shouldn't rush.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.519
I'll do my best for you.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:02.680
No, I mean—

00:20:03.599 --> 00:20:04.839
I'm talking about marriage.

00:20:04.839 --> 00:20:06.279
I'm still unsure.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.000
They're actually thinking of getting married.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.680
My last marriage was a disaster.

00:20:14.119 --> 00:20:16.359
I even got scammed out of a lot of money.

00:20:16.519 --> 00:20:18.440
Now I want Meng to take over.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.279
We've been together for over a year.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.720
Lately, I really want to get married.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.640
I've been lying to Lili for over a year.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.480
But all my girlfriends tell me

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.599
to be careful.

00:20:30.079 --> 00:20:31.400
At my age,

00:20:32.119 --> 00:20:33.599
why bother with a second marriage?

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.480
Right?

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:36.599
Playing hard to get, huh?

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.839
So lately,

00:20:37.839 --> 00:20:39.079
I've been really conflicted.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.079
My heart is a mess.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.400
Isn't that a song lyric?

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.480
My heart is a mess,

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:48.880
my mind is blank.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:49.440
Meng Hang?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:51.400
I'm here.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:52.920
What's up with you?

00:20:53.559 --> 00:20:55.240
Let's go upstairs and see the garden.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.079
The garden?

00:20:57.839 --> 00:20:59.240
I love gardens the most.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:20:59.680
Let's go.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.359
Come on, let's go.

00:21:00.359 --> 00:21:03.400
But your stairs are way too steep.

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:09.119
The party at fault in a marriage

00:21:09.279 --> 00:21:11.799
gets less in property division

00:21:11.799 --> 00:21:13.920
based on how serious the fault is

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.319
when splitting assets.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.039
Son-in-law cheating—what luck!

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.839
How did I get so lucky?

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.359
Divorce him and take a big chunk of cash.

00:21:25.599 --> 00:21:26.839
I'll buy a ticket right away

00:21:26.839 --> 00:21:29.119
and wait for the spaceship at the South Pole.

00:21:32.279 --> 00:21:33.680
What's got you so happy?

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.200
Let me ask you—

00:21:37.319 --> 00:21:39.359
if you divorce Meng,

00:21:39.359 --> 00:21:40.519
how much can you get?

00:21:40.559 --> 00:21:41.319
Not a cent.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.519
He's that stingy?

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.200
We won't ever get divorced.

00:21:45.279 --> 00:21:47.119
Can't you try a bit harder?

00:21:48.839 --> 00:21:49.880
Not divorcing is fine too.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.240
You could stage an accident.

00:21:51.599 --> 00:21:52.200
That way,

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.559
you'd get the inheritance.

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:54.799
Mom,

00:21:55.359 --> 00:21:57.200
besides studying Marriage Law every day,

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.799
can you learn some Criminal Law too?

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.400
No, that's not it—

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.039
Listen to me,

00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:03.039
today,

00:22:03.079 --> 00:22:04.440
show me my little darling.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:06.839
Dad.

00:22:07.319 --> 00:22:07.880
Dad.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.119
Dad.

00:22:10.799 --> 00:22:12.480
I'm in the middle of a solo.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.359
You shouting like that

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.160
just ruined it.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.119
Now there's nothing left.

00:22:15.119 --> 00:22:15.599
Uh...

00:22:15.599 --> 00:22:16.599
The pet shop key—

00:22:16.599 --> 00:22:17.079
hand it over, please.

00:22:17.079 --> 00:22:18.359
I'm going to check on the Teddy.

00:22:18.839 --> 00:22:19.519
What Teddy?

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.119
The little puppy I gave you.

00:22:22.519 --> 00:22:23.519
That stray dog?

00:22:23.519 --> 00:22:24.839
Old Gao gave it to his granddaughter.

00:22:25.279 --> 00:22:26.039
What?

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:27.720
You gave—

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.039
Mom, weren't you at the pet shop too?

00:22:33.039 --> 00:22:34.400
Why didn't you keep an eye on it?

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.200
I had something to do, so I left.

00:22:36.559 --> 00:22:37.240
Let me tell you—

00:22:37.319 --> 00:22:38.319
I've noticed Meng—

00:22:38.319 --> 00:22:39.799
either starts a video call for me,

00:22:40.079 --> 00:22:41.880
or I give you a resignation letter.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.039
Got it?

00:22:49.359 --> 00:22:50.039
Sis

00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:51.599
That little Sabrina,

00:22:51.599 --> 00:22:53.160
she's not with me right now.

00:22:53.319 --> 00:22:54.440
She went out to play.

00:22:54.559 --> 00:22:56.039
I'll look for her in a bit.

00:22:57.079 --> 00:22:57.720
Isn't she right there?

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.440
She's behind you.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.319
Lili

00:23:02.519 --> 00:23:04.160
I'm back from walking the dog.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.640
Just took her out for a walk.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.839
Move your phone over there.

00:23:08.839 --> 00:23:10.119
Let me take a look.

00:23:11.519 --> 00:23:12.279
She

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.920
is asleep.

00:23:14.599 --> 00:23:16.160
Maybe outside just now,

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.759
she barked too much at the female dog.

00:23:17.759 --> 00:23:18.400
She's tired.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.160
Look,

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.920
she's even snoring.

00:23:24.839 --> 00:23:25.799
Check this out.

00:23:25.799 --> 00:23:27.279
She's snoring, Sis.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.759
Let's not disturb her for now.

00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:29.319
Tomorrow you

00:23:29.319 --> 00:23:30.559
I'll bring her to the office for you.

00:23:30.559 --> 00:23:31.279
Don't worry.

00:23:31.559 --> 00:23:32.400
Give her your phone.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.119
What?

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.799
Can't hear, bad signal.

00:23:34.799 --> 00:23:35.720
I'll hang up now.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.599
I want to see the dog.

00:23:42.319 --> 00:23:43.160
Where's the dog?

00:23:43.759 --> 00:23:45.079
Old Gao gave her to his granddaughter.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.240
Fun, right?

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:51.839
Yeah, fun.

00:23:52.279 --> 00:23:53.119
Let her run around.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.799
But right now,

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:56.960
she's a bit tired.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:58.799
Fun, huh?

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.640
Uncle Gao

00:24:02.519 --> 00:24:03.240
This dog—

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.119
Did you buy her from my dad's pet shop?

00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:06.359
Of course not.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.079
No, it's not.

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:08.440
Right.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.680
Your dad gave her to me.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.559
Didn't charge me.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:13.799
Well,

00:24:13.799 --> 00:24:14.519
Uncle,

00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:16.240
I need to tell you something.

00:24:16.279 --> 00:24:17.200
About this dog—

00:24:17.519 --> 00:24:18.960
She's my boss lady's dog.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.799
She's just staying at the pet shop.

00:24:21.119 --> 00:24:22.319
Not for sale or giveaway.

00:24:22.319 --> 00:24:23.400
My dad made a mistake.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.519
So I have to take her back.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:26.720
No, wait, don't—

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.920
She's my Candy.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.559
She has her own name.

00:24:30.559 --> 00:24:31.920
Her name is Sabrina.

00:24:32.319 --> 00:24:33.359
Come, Sabrina, come.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.559
Don't just snatch her.

00:24:35.559 --> 00:24:37.160
No, I really have to take her.

00:24:37.559 --> 00:24:39.119
Look, the kid's crying.

00:24:39.119 --> 00:24:39.960
Darn it.

00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:41.480
How about this—

00:24:41.599 --> 00:24:42.839
My granddaughter Changchang,

00:24:42.839 --> 00:24:44.039
she's stubborn.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.200
I'll talk to her later.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.440
Come back tomorrow.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.079
She's my Candy.

00:24:48.079 --> 00:24:48.880
No, Uncle—

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.000
Then, when I'm at work,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:50.920
I have to take her back.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:51.799
Otherwise, my job—

00:24:51.799 --> 00:24:52.319
You tomor—

00:24:52.319 --> 00:24:53.640
Can you come back tomorrow?

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.240
Then tomorrow,

00:24:55.359 --> 00:24:56.240
you have to give her to me.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.200
Okay, okay.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:57.559
Let's go, let's go.

00:24:57.559 --> 00:24:58.200
Tomorrow.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:58.720
Then you—

00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.559
Give her to me tomorrow.

00:24:59.559 --> 00:25:00.359
Alright, alright.

00:25:00.359 --> 00:25:01.039
You go first.

00:25:05.319 --> 00:25:05.559
Go on.

00:25:05.559 --> 00:25:05.960
Then I'll—

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:06.880
I'll come back tomorrow.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.440
Okay.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:08.680
It's fine now.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.240
Alright, alright.

00:25:15.799 --> 00:25:17.680
Mom, you wanted to see me?

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.759
I'll just say it straight.

00:25:24.799 --> 00:25:25.720
Today,

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.319
I went to your company.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.799
Then,

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.880
at the Feicui Huafu entrance,

00:25:32.079 --> 00:25:34.519
I saw you walk in with a lady.

00:25:35.319 --> 00:25:37.839
Darn it, Mom knows I'm just an agent.

00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:39.440
Mom, you know everything.

00:25:42.279 --> 00:25:44.640
I really didn't mean to lie to you.

00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:46.599
So next,

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.880
just answer whatever I ask.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.680
Be completely honest.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.039
The house you picked for that lady—

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.960
Not cheap, right?

00:25:55.359 --> 00:25:56.279
High-end neighborhood.

00:25:56.279 --> 00:25:58.000
Tomorrow, show her a few more.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.400
There's this one—

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.559
Vienna Gongguan,

00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:02.079
Mingmen Shoufu,

00:26:02.279 --> 00:26:03.319
Baijin Haoting.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.960
These names—

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.880
Really think they're

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.920
nobles scattered among the people.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.799
Are these all yours?

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.559
That whole area belongs to me.

00:26:19.079 --> 00:26:21.200
Why'd you find a lady?

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:22.759
Me—

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.359
I treat everyone the same.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.559
No matter who it is,

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.279
I have to give good service.

00:26:27.279 --> 00:26:28.640
No matter who.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.960
So there were others before?

00:26:31.039 --> 00:26:31.880
A lot.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.119
Just exposed myself.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.160
You really don't treat me as an outsider.

00:26:38.119 --> 00:26:38.759
Mom,

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.000
please don't be mad.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.359
Why would I be mad?

00:26:42.839 --> 00:26:44.839
Respect and give my blessing.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.359
Ms. Niu called.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.279
How about—

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:55.799
I'll go back to my room.

00:26:57.559 --> 00:26:59.440
Does your dad know about this?

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.319
He knows.

00:27:00.599 --> 00:27:02.319
Dad really supports me.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.480
A whole family of moral low ground.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.880
Changchang,

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.720
why are you here again?

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.680
Look what good stuff I brought you.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.079
Here.

00:27:32.839 --> 00:27:34.759
My mom won't let me eat junk food.

00:27:35.319 --> 00:27:36.079
That's fine.

00:27:36.079 --> 00:27:37.119
Then you can't have snacks.

00:27:37.119 --> 00:27:37.920
Look, there are toys too.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.519
See?

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.240
Nothing's better than my Candy.

00:27:50.079 --> 00:27:51.519
What do we do with this kid?

00:28:09.119 --> 00:28:10.240
Did you see it?

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.319
It's a monster.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.000
Auntie has to take it back now.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.200
To cure it.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.960
Otherwise, it might hurt you.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.119
Don't be too sad.

00:28:29.599 --> 00:28:30.759
Here, have this to eat.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:41.799
Monster.

00:28:41.799 --> 00:28:43.799
Not all monsters are bad, right?

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.079
Give it to Candy.

00:28:53.079 --> 00:28:55.720
I bought all these with my New Year money.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:02.440
Want.

00:29:02.599 --> 00:29:03.359
Or not.

00:29:07.839 --> 00:29:09.880
I can't help it either.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:13.599
Sorry about that.

00:29:15.119 --> 00:29:15.759
Then I...

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.440
Why do I feel like I'm Fahai now?

00:29:40.799 --> 00:29:41.440
Come, Ms. Niu.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.039
Take a look at this one.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.119
This is definitely my top recommendation for you.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.519
This floor.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.880
North-south facing, great ventilation.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.440
The layout is really nice.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.680
And also,

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.160
Well,

00:29:58.039 --> 00:29:59.960
The owner is eager to sell.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.839
It's cheaper than the previous ones.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:07.920
Ms. Niu...

00:30:10.279 --> 00:30:10.920
Meng Hang.

00:30:11.759 --> 00:30:13.799
I'm still really conflicted.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.559
About getting married.

00:30:16.759 --> 00:30:18.039
I'll put it aside for now.

00:30:18.279 --> 00:30:20.039
I won't think about the house for now.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:22.599
Alright then.

00:30:22.839 --> 00:30:23.480
So...

00:30:24.079 --> 00:30:25.480
Contact me if you need anything later.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.839
Sorry for wasting your time.

00:30:29.759 --> 00:30:30.960
It's no big deal.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.119
Well...

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.559
As for a second marriage...

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.960
I've never been married.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.480
So I can't really comment.

00:30:41.799 --> 00:30:42.519
But,

00:30:42.519 --> 00:30:43.960
I've handled more than a hundred resales.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.880
Really, over a hundred.

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.200
I've learned a few things.

00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:49.480
Look at this house.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.039
No matter how many owners it's had,

00:30:51.519 --> 00:30:52.720
As long as you like it,

00:30:53.319 --> 00:30:55.640
It'll be our one and only home.

00:30:56.359 --> 00:30:57.039
Wait a second.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.319
Our home?

00:31:04.839 --> 00:31:05.400
Really?

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.799
Did you forget you already have a home?

00:31:08.119 --> 00:31:09.559
There's still someone at home—

00:31:09.559 --> 00:31:11.839
A wife through thick and thin who loves to eat and laze.

00:31:12.039 --> 00:31:12.759
Mom.

00:31:12.759 --> 00:31:13.319
You...

00:31:13.799 --> 00:31:14.799
Looks like in your family,

00:31:14.799 --> 00:31:17.279
the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law don't get along.

00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:17.599
No, that's not it.

00:31:17.599 --> 00:31:19.039
She's my wife's mom.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.119
Mom.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.279
Why did you rush to find me?

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.200
I'll head out then.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.000
So...

00:31:29.599 --> 00:31:30.359
Wait.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.720
How can you not air family scandals?

00:31:37.519 --> 00:31:40.160
Otherwise, how do you negotiate a divorce?

00:31:41.079 --> 00:31:42.160
Divorce?

00:31:45.119 --> 00:31:46.000
Who's getting divorced?

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.119
I was just afraid you'd look down on me.

00:31:53.119 --> 00:31:54.759
So I casually said I was

00:31:54.759 --> 00:31:55.799
in real estate.

00:31:56.519 --> 00:31:58.920
Let me try to understand.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.480
Agent.

00:32:00.759 --> 00:32:01.519
So,

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.519
One end connects to the seller,

00:32:03.519 --> 00:32:05.200
the other to the buyer.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:05.680
Right.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.319
Both ends make money,

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.119
but in the middle,

00:32:08.119 --> 00:32:08.680
no money.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:10.720
That's true.

00:32:11.319 --> 00:32:11.960
But,

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.200
Please believe me.

00:32:13.519 --> 00:32:15.440
I'm sincere about Lili.

00:32:16.559 --> 00:32:18.680
You don't need her to believe.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.359
It's our life together,

00:32:20.359 --> 00:32:21.799
not for her to judge.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.079
Right, Sis?

00:32:23.079 --> 00:32:24.000
You've been through this.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.519
That's right.

00:32:26.559 --> 00:32:27.200
Sis.

00:32:40.119 --> 00:32:40.960
Morning, Boss lady.

00:32:44.599 --> 00:32:45.200
Sis.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.480
The kennel owner tricked me.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.359
This isn't royal bloodline at all.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.240
But I bought a new little one.

00:32:54.279 --> 00:32:54.839
Look.

00:32:55.319 --> 00:32:56.680
Dutch Lop Rabbit imported from Holland.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.160
But it only cost two thousand.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:00.799
You two.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.359
New look.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.559
How is it?

00:33:05.039 --> 00:33:06.039
Let your hair down.

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.319
And change your hair clip.

00:33:09.839 --> 00:33:10.799
Matched again.

00:33:18.079 --> 00:33:19.279
Sis, what about this little Sabrina?

00:33:19.279 --> 00:33:20.119
Don't want it, you take it.

00:33:31.119 --> 00:33:32.799
After hearing what Meng said,

00:33:33.279 --> 00:33:34.799
why do I feel

00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:37.480
a little happy for Lili?

00:33:38.359 --> 00:33:39.400
No, no.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.759
That's so embarrassing.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.440
I must be sick.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.319
Here they come.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.599
Uncle.

00:33:55.599 --> 00:33:56.400
Hello, Uncle.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.599
Why are you here?

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:58.759
Um...

00:33:58.759 --> 00:34:00.200
We're here to return the dog.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.279
Come in.

00:34:06.119 --> 00:34:07.160
Changchang.

00:34:07.559 --> 00:34:08.119
Look.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.960
Candy.

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:11.800
You're back.

00:34:16.039 --> 00:34:16.800
Uncle, so...

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.199
We've brought the dog back, we...

00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:22.079
Uh, this...

00:34:22.599 --> 00:34:23.639
This is...

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.800
For me?

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:27.159
Thank you.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.039
You're welcome.

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:33.320
It's pretty cute.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.280
Um, Uncle...

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.639
We'll head out now.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.000
Alright.

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:41.360
Bye-bye.

00:34:41.519 --> 00:34:42.199
Bye-bye.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.239
So is Candy still a monster?

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:54.840
No.

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.679
It's cured now.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.800
Now it's just a cute little dog.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.159
You actually said those two words just now.

00:35:12.079 --> 00:35:12.880
What?

00:35:13.159 --> 00:35:13.880
Cute.

00:35:16.639 --> 00:35:18.039
Impossible.

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.440
How could I say such disgusting words?

00:35:20.679 --> 00:35:21.679
You must be mistaken.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.480
That's so embarrassing.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.760
Did you...

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.519
get over your allergic to cuteness?

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:38.639
Cute.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.480
Little bunny.

00:35:43.639 --> 00:35:44.880
Kitten.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.079
A little fish.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:46.880
It's gone.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:47.719
Definitely gone.

00:35:47.719 --> 00:35:48.400
I'm so cute,

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.599
and she doesn't react at all.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.159
That's great.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.400
Ms. Niu signed the contract.

00:36:01.519 --> 00:36:02.400
That one—

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.280
My mom's imaginary mistress, right?

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:04.840
Yeah.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:05.559
That's her.

00:36:06.519 --> 00:36:08.199
She said she's getting married.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.079
She also said

00:36:09.079 --> 00:36:11.119
this time must be bigger than last time.

00:36:11.119 --> 00:36:12.519
She wants it to be high-profile.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.639
Look, look!

00:36:15.159 --> 00:36:16.360
She even posted wedding photos.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.239
That's nice.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:18.840
See?

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.400
It's the wedding, right?

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.599
Such a hassle.

00:36:22.679 --> 00:36:24.480
Good thing we don't have to go through that.

00:36:26.519 --> 00:36:27.119
Right.

00:36:29.039 --> 00:36:29.679
Yeah.

00:36:29.679 --> 00:36:31.599
Young people don't care about that stuff.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.119
Red carpet,

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:34.679
wedding dress,

00:36:34.679 --> 00:36:35.599
flowers,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.199
beautiful blessings,

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.599
and those

00:36:39.599 --> 00:36:42.280
tear-jerking vows.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.159
I do.

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.400
What are you mumbling?

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.440
Go to sleep.

00:37:11.119 --> 00:37:12.199
I do.

00:37:27.239 --> 00:37:28.559
Lili.

00:37:28.559 --> 00:37:29.960
No way.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:37.480
Back then,

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:38.880
I was allergic to cuteness.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.760
When I saw a puppy,

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.719
it was like humans seeing a toad.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:44.760
So why did I return the toad

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.880
to Changchang?

00:37:46.639 --> 00:37:47.719
To me,

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.199
the toad wasn't important.

00:37:49.719 --> 00:37:52.159
But Changchang's love for the toad was.

00:37:52.679 --> 00:37:54.039
I feel nothing for the toad.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.239
But for Changchang,

00:37:55.239 --> 00:37:57.039
her love for the toad moves me.

00:37:58.039 --> 00:37:59.039
So,

00:37:59.079 --> 00:38:00.159
what I care about

00:38:00.159 --> 00:38:01.239
isn't the toad,

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.480
nor Changchang,

00:38:02.719 --> 00:38:04.719
but human love itself.

00:38:05.639 --> 00:38:06.119
Right.

00:38:06.639 --> 00:38:07.280
Love.

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.440
is cute.
