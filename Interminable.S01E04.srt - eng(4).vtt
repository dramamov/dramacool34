I can feel there’s also someone else in this house.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.280
Are you all right, dear?

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.160
You can see him, Khun Kaew?

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.280
Of course, I can see him. I have eyes.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.880
Is it possible that someone I saw in my dream,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.120
would also exist in real life as if they are the same person?

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.159
Is there something you want to talk to me?

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.360
What?

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.520
But it looks like you’re waiting for me to come out of my room.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.800
Are you following me, Khun Yai?

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.360
We’re probably destined to meet wherever we go.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.720
Ruedee, why do you want to see me?

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.560
My cousin, Sophee, wants you to draw for her.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.360
But Ruedee, you also know, don’t you?

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.440
That I can’t draw a portrait.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.760
I know. I already tried to refuse it for you.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.800
But she still insisted she used to see a portrait you drew.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.440
That’s why she really wants you to draw for her.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.800
Where did she see it?

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.960
I wonder too.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.000
I’m also curious but I was too scared to ask.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.000
So, my mother told me to ask you first.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.640
I really want to help you, Ruedee.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.240
But what if I say yes…

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.240
and end up unable to draw it?

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.000
Then don’t do it. Don’t say yes.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.000
I don’t want you to draw for her anyway.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.440
But…will you get into trouble if I don’t do it?

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.240
Isn’t she your cousin?

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.920
Who cares? I can’t be bothered.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.120
Let’s not do it then.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.240
It’s better to stay away from her.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.120
So…

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.360
How did you get here?

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.360
Did your driver take you here?

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.480
Oh my goodness.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.480

Hello, Chai.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.760
I didn’t know you’re also here.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.640
Hello, Kaew.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.000
Ruedee told me she wanted to see you.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.800
So, I volunteered to be her driver.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.880
She said she has something important to talk to you in private.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.520
It’s a beautiful house.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.880
Please come inside then.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.120
Yes.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.080
You really live here.

Wait, who are you?

It’s me who should be asking that. Who are you?

How dare you come in and walk around this white house so leisurely?

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.840
Saen.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.160
Have some manners.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.600
He’s a guest…

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.160
who came uninvited.

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.240
Chai,

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.760
this is Khun Yai and Saen.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.480
They also live here.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.000

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.240
Hello.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.480
A pleasure to meet you.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.400
I’m Chai, an older brother of Ruedee...

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.600
Kaewta’s best friend.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.120
I just came back from Amsterdam.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.600
Should we sit down and talk?

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.200
Sure.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.159
This house is so beautiful, Kaew.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.520
It’s called a white house…

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.680
because the entire house is painted white.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.200
Looking this impressive,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.240
I guess the owner of this house…

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.760
must surely have it built with love.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:03.560
Well, the owner had this house built to live with his lover.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.640
But somehow…

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.040
it also looks quite eerie.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.520
Hello.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.200

She’s Nanny Yam.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:38.600
What do you mean by ‘eerie’, Mister?

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.240
Well, I mean…

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:55.080
I see you have another guest, so I’m bringing more drinks, Khun Kaew.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.640
Let me help.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.320
Thank you. I’m kind of thirsty right now.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:17.720
Why…

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.640
Why is it so bitter?

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.520
Of course it’s bitter. It’s giloy juice.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:32.160
Nanny Yam, do you usually welcome your guests with giloy juice?

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.880
Giloy juice with honey is good for your health.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.880
But I’m afraid I must have forgotten to add honey.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.240
I’ll make you a new one then.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.400
That’s all right. I’m full now.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.200
Thank you, Nanny.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.040
Please leave the rest to me.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.560

Kaew.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.440
Ruedee told me you’ve inherited this house from the previous owner, is that right?

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.280
Yes.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.560
The previous owner of this house…

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.640
is Chao Meun Samur Chairatch.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.120
I only found out recently that my father was his distant relative.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.440
But I think it’s strange, Kaew.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:44.040
If they were actually related, why had your father never mentioned about him before?

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.120
Have you tried to verify it?

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.080
My mother is the only relative I have left.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:58.000
Relatives on my father’s side are all gone. I don’t know where to…

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.280
…get the information from.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.680
That makes it even stranger, Kaew.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.440
I think…

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.720
How…

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.560
How on earth did it fall down?

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.040
Yeah.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.520
It gave me a fright.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.840

- Yes.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.040
Yes? Yes!

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:44.880
Yes? What is it?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.240
Are you all right? I’ve been calling you for a while.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.200
It’s…

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.640
It’s nothing.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.000
Let’s go home then. We’ve left for quite some time now. Mother might be worried.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.320
Okay.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.040
Kaew, I’m leaving then.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.200
Okay, I’ll walk you out.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.040
Goodbye, Khun Yai. Goodbye, Saen.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:20.840
Be careful.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:22.880
Let’s go.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.600
Can’t he walk himself to the car?

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.640
Why must Kaew walk him out?

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.800
What are you standing there for? Clean it up.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.800
Yes, sir.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.640
Has your uninvited guest gone back home?

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.040
Who do you mean, Khun Yai?

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.920
Ruedee?

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.520
I mean…

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.400
the one who kept walking all over this place.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.600
No manners.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.720
If you mean Chai,

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.960
he is my friend’s–Ruedee’s brother.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.520
Not an uninvited guest.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:38.200
Nonetheless, he shouldn’t have walked around without asking for permission from the owner first.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.960
He just wanted to take a look around the house.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.680
Please don’t take it seriously.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.800
Are you sure…

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.480
…that he only wanted to look at the house?

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:54.720
Yes.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.080
Do you have a problem with that?

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.720
He’s clearly interested in…

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.120
Don’t ever invite him here again.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.640
This is an order.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.720
What’s wrong with him?

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.480
Make sure you prepare everything as ordered.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.600
Yes, Miss.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.200
Brother, what are you thinking?

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.720
Ruedee.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.600
Who is Khun Yai?

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.440
Why is he also staying at the white house?

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:06.400
Kaew said he’s a friend of the previous owner.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.800
That’s why he’s allowed to live there.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.520
Is something bothering your mind, Brother?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.560
I think he’s quite off.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.440
How?

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.600
I can't point out exactly.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:38.360
Actually, I also feel the same.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:43.680
I also find it strange how he looks exactly like that man in Kaew’s dream.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.720
In Kaew’s dream?

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.600
What do you mean?

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.120
Well…

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.080
Kaew used to tell me he had been dreaming of this man for a long time.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.320
Until he came to live at the white house.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.880
Before that, he wasn’t able to draw any portrait.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.320
But after he’s moved in, he could suddenly draw the portrait of this man.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.280
Then what?

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.040
It turns out that man in his dream also exists in real life.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.680
It’s Khun Yai.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.560
What a coincidence.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.920
Please excuse me then, I have to go to the kitchen.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.040
Okay.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.400
The man from his dream?

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.120
Is it really possible to have such coincidence?

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.600
Where are Sin and Saen?

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.800
I thought they would come and give alms to the monk together.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.640
Can I join you in this merit-making?

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.960
Go ahead.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:13.200
Thank you.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.920
Oh, here he comes.

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:26.560
Greetings, Luangta.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.800
Bless you.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.480
So, the time has come.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.360
Luangta, I have a question.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.000
What is it that you want to know?

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.880
Sharing merits in this life to be together in the next – is it true or just a belief…

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.520
…that it would make us be together in every life?

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.640
If you keep making merits together…

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.360
and always observe the five precepts,

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.920
you will always find each other.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.920
I see. So it’s not just a belief then.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.520
Time to receive blessings.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:28.840
(The Buddhist chant to give blessings to merit makers)

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.800
Bless you.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.720
Amen.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.160
If that’s the case,

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.560
can I join you to give alms to the monk every day?

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.840
Of course.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.560
What’s wrong with him?

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.280
We’ve been through a lot before we could be together.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.680
I won’t give up so easily.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.680
My brother,

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.720
are you back?

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.520
Sophee.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.520
I’ve been waiting here since afternoon. No one told me you’d be home this late.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.120
I had some matters to attend to.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.720
You could’ve asked someone to call for me. Why trouble yourself like this?

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.120
You haven’t come to eat with us at the main house for many days.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.920
Father is also worried something might happen to you.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.520
I’m fine.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.160
I’m just tired. I’ll feel better after I get some rest.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.800
Then, I’ll go prepare some tonic and bring it to you here.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.360
I’m fine indeed.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.760
It’s late, you should leave.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.440
Our servants might be gossiping about it.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.120
You’ve only seen my face for less than a minute and you’re shooing me away.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.080
Fine, I’ll go back to my place.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.280
I’m just an adopted son.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.440
And you’re a lady.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.040
A man and a lady shouldn’t be too close to each other.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.920
Or people might talk badly about them.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.600
You don’t have to try to convince me with those reasons.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.560
I’m leaving.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.840
Please tell Father for me that I’ll pay him a visit tomorrow morning.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.120
Yes. Let’s go, Som.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.120
Yes, Miss. Please be careful and watch your steps.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.080
Let’s go, Saen.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.000
Yes, sir.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.080
Lady Chuichai…

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.920
…is a guy?

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.920
Do I really like men?

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.200
You can resist anything in this world.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.040
But you shall never resist the yearning in your heart.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.080
You can break all the bonds there is in this world.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.600
But you shall never break the bond of love that is binding your heart.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.840
Khun Phra Nai, the servant Som would like to see you, sir.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.360
Khun Phra Nai is busy right now. You can leave your message with me.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.120
But what I’m going to tell him is…

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.120
What do you want?

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.680
Say it.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:42.960
A servant from Luang Sanor’s place has told me that Khun Luang would like to see you.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.360
It’s something important. That’s why I’m here to tell you, sir.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:39.560
Geez, he’s trying to get over it…why does it have to be now?

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.280
You’re here, Khun Yai?

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.640
You guys, let’s stop for a while.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.720
Again, Uncle?

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.480
If we have to stop practising this often,

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:06.080
wouldn’t you be embarrassed if we can’t dance properly in front of the audience?

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.120
Geez, this brat.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.080
I have a guest, can’t you see?

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.000
Good morning, Uncle.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.520
Bless you, son.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.680
Come in. Have a seat first.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.760
How are you, Khun Phra? Are you doing well?

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:24.680
Yes.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:33.840
Oh, crap. Did I just pick a fight with a Lord?

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.560
What was that, Kaew?

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.400
Whom did you pick a fight with?

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.600
Nothing.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.040
Khun Phra Nai is so handsome.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.480
Let’s go, Ruedee.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.000
We should prepare drinks for our guests.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:55.560
Okay.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.600
I have an important matter to talk to you.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.240
Khun Yai.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.080
Khun Yai!

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.840
Yes, Uncle?

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.920
The way I tried to woo him, didn’t it work?

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.200
Do you mean, “Sharing merit in this life to be together in the next”?

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.320
Damn you, Saen. You’re getting more brazen these days.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.680
My apologies, Khun Yai.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.640
But that Khun Kaew is a different person from this Khun Kaew.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.280
Yeah, you’re right.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.360
The era is also different.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.440
If you still use the same way to woo him,

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:56.120
Khun Kaew might think you’re an outdated poet from the past.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.920
That’s true.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.840
I’m afraid I’ll have to change my tactic.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.960
Couldn’t agree more.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.920
Sin.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:12.800
Yes, Khun Kaew?

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.280
Is there anything I can help?

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.520
Why would you bother, Khun Kaew? Please let me do it.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:23.040
It’s fine. You can go dump the leaves in that basket.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.040
Let me take care of the rest.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.600
Are you sure?

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.920
You’re so diligent, Khun Kaew.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.880
Okay then. Thank you!

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.400
Is this the renowned white house of Chao Meun Samur Chairatch?

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.640
Lady Sophee.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:14.600
Is this the renowned white house of Chao Meun Samur Chairatch?

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.800
No! Nooo!

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.800
Miss Sophee.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.880
Oh, shit.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.280
Aren’t you going to invite me into your house?

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:52.920
This way please.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.400
Trouble, trouble! We have trouble!

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.200
Watch your manners. Haven’t I told you many times already?

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.760
Geez, Dad, this isn’t the time to complain. Do you know who’s just come?

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.360
Who?

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.080
Sophee.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.760
Why is Lady Sophee here?

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.120
Yeah.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.960
I’d like to know that too.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.600
Will she be able to see us, Khun Yai?

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:00.760
I don’t know.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.040
But if she does,

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.680
it means she has also reincarnated…

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.560
and probably can’t remember anything about her past life.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.040
How many people live here?

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.080
Think carefully before you answer.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.240
There are Khun Kaew, his mother, and me.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.520
Oh, and also a couple of faithful servants.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.840
Sin!

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.040
They are working in the back.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.960
Would you like me to introduce them to you now, Miss?

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.320
No need.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.160
Where’s the house owner?

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.240
The house owner right now…

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.320
is Khun Kaewta.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.520
Lady Sophee can’t see us, Khun Yai.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.560
That might be because…

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.120
Sophee and I have no more karma left to share.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.480
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.320
This snack…

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.080
is made by my mother fresh from the oven.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.480
Thanks.

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:34.760
From what I’ve learnt, this white house used to belong to Chao Meun Samur Chairatch.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.800
How come you’re here in his place?

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.640
I have inherited this house from the previous owner.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.280
I’m his relative.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:47.920
Is that so?

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:52.160
You, a relative of a high-ranking nobleman?

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.760
On my father’s side (of the family).

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.320
That’s what they told me.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.240
Are you sure?

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.400
Pardon me,

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.720
but what matter brings you here?

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:23.400
I suppose Ruedee has already told you
how I’d like you to draw my portrait, hasn’t she?

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:27.840
Yes.

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.560
But…

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.720
I’m afraid I’ll have to turn down your request.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.400
Hasn’t Ruedee told you that I refused?

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:41.200
She has. But I want to hear the reason from you in person. Why can’t you do it?

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.440
I can’t draw a portrait of anyone.

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.240
Don’t lie.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.200
I’ve seen your drawing before.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.640
Where did you see it?

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:02.280
The university you’re studying at. My family is one of the land donors.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.280
I also fund a scholarship for top students.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:10.000
So, it’s not surprising that I’d know your professor.

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:16.159
Here is the portrait that Kaewta drew, as you’ve ordered.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.679
What if I want to buy this drawing,

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:43.800
will you sell it to me?

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:48.760
Even though I was the one who asked my students to draw,

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.520
I’m afraid I don’t own any of their works.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.320
A small token for your help.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.600
Ten times more than last time.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.760
I guess we’re settled then.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.480
I miss you so much, my love.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.160
Kaewta.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.080
Does this mean…

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.840
Kaewta has met him already?

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.720
You saw my drawing from Ajarn Kitti?

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:58.440
Yes, now how else are you going to lie about it?

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.400
I’m not lying.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.920
I really can’t draw a portrait.

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.120
I…

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.880
I’ve tried.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.320
What about the portrait of my…

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.520
of that man?

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.840
That’s the first and only portrait I could draw.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:26.840
Is there such a thing like that? How ridiculous.

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.880
If you don’t believe it,

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.440
then I have nothing else to say.

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:42.520
But of course, I believe you. You’ve firmly insisted it like that.

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:47.280
Anyway, how’s that man in the drawing special to you?

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.680
Why is he the only portrait you can draw?

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.640
I also…

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.800
don’t understand it either.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.880
Where did you see him?

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:05.920
Sin!

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.680
Well…

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.840
Where is it? I’m asking you, answer me.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.360
Sin!

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.000
It’s…

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.960
It was in his dream.

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.600
Khun Kaewta told me…

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:29.800
he saw that man in his dream, Miss.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.240
Really?

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.080
Yes.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.120
I drew it from what I saw my dream.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:48.160
Even in a dream, you could still see my man?

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.960
Are you trying to brag about it?

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.560
Such a pretentious bitch since past life.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.480
Is her visit still bothering your mind, Khun Yai?

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.960
Today when Sophee came,

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.680
I could feel something was off.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.120
What do you mean?

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:29.000
Why did she want to know how many people live here?

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.160
You’re right!

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:38.600
Miss Sophee also asked Sin about the owner of this place.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.920
And even asked Kaewta about my portrait.

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.560
She’s certainly suspicious.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.440
You’re here?

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:24.720
Yes.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.480
I have an urgent matter that needs your advice, Khun Luang…

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.280
mean, Luangta.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.280
His enemy in the past life has finally found him, hasn’t she?

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.200
You knew?

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:45.760
So…

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.080
What should I do then?

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:56.480
Karma has a mysterious power. No one can ever escape the hands of Karma.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:04.320
The only thing you can do is be mindful, and brace yourself for whatever that will happen.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.360
I understand.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.200
I’m curious now, Som.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.960
About what, my lady?

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:04.400
I’m curious what exactly it is that Luang Sanor is trying to teach his dancers.

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:09.480
Is it perhaps for them to seduce the men?

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:10.880
I believe so too.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.560
Don’t talk about him like that.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.480
Why can’t I? It’s the truth.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.280
A classical dance is an art of training and worshipping the masters.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.560
It’s something delicate and graceful…

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.880
…invented by the mankind.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.360
Those who are civilized…

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.320
…shall never look down on such a prestigious art.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.400
Civilized?

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:40.760
Look down? Prestigious? A person like you doesn’t need those things.

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.320
Your hair…

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.800
It’s so important to you, isn’t it?

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.840
Here you go, my lady.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.480
No! No! Don’t! Don’t!

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.480
No! Don’t!

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.400
No! No!

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.320
Don’t!

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.600
No!

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.960
No!

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.280
Filthy bitch.

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.000
Don’t!

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.960
What kind of dream is that?

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:38.880
Why does it feel so real?

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.680
Who is it?

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.760
Is it Saen or Sin?

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.480
How do they know I want to draw?

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:38.840
Khun Yai.

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.680
Don’t forget to draw the portrait of that person you’re thinking of.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.760
I beg your pardon.

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:56.760
If you miss someone, draw that person.

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.480
But if you don’t know whom to draw,

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.480
I’m always here to model for you.

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:39.520
What was I thinking?

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:42.920
So?

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:46.560
Am I fortunate enough to model for your drawing?

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.400
Of course.

00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.280
Go ahead.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.720
Why are you blushing?

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:37.840
Is it hot?

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:39.960
Or are you not feeling well?

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:43.600
Nothing.

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:46.560
I’m fine.

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:48.720
Hey.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.240
You look even redder now.

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:53.600
How could you say you’re fine?

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.320
Your choices of words are quite odd.

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.400
Like those in an ancient book.

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:03.800
I’m ancient indeed.

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.080
I mean…

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.320
My mind still remains in the ancient time.

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:17.120
The time when we were still together.

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.160
How could that be possible?

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.720
We’ve just known each other.

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.240
Have you given it a thought?

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.360
Are you sure we’ve never met before?

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.680
I’ve changed my mind.

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.120
I’m going to read some books.

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.040
Please excuse me.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:24.200
Karma has a mysterious power. No one can ever escape the hands of Karma.

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:31.800
The only thing you can do is be mindful, and brace yourself for whatever that will happen.

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.280
I hope you’ll remember me…

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.880
before anything will happen.

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.440
Have you given it a thought?

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.760
Are you sure we’ve never met before?

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.760
I’m sure this is the first time we met.

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:15.520
Why would he want me to think about it again?

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.800
Excuse me, sir.

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:09.760
Khun Yai.

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:12.440
I’m sorry.

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:49.720
Will you draw for me and only me, my dear?

00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:58.400
Yes.

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:08.200
Promise?

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:55.480
When did I fall asleep?

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.520
[Next Episode]
Why does Ajarn Kitti want you to take your drawing back today?

00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:20.440
I wonder too.

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:22.560
There’s no one here.

00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:27.080
Kaew!

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:28.000
Kaew!

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:28.720
Kaew!

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:29.400
Khun Yai!

00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:30.600
Kaew is in danger.

00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:31.520
You can’t go.

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:32.720
Let me go!

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:35.560
You want me to stand here and let that bastard hurt him?

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:46.120
How dare you, scumbag!

00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:54.800
Khun Yai, are you in here?

00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:14.040
Let's wait and see what interesting story this episode four has.

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:15.920
What will happen to Khun Yai?

00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:19.160
And what role will Chai play?

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:25.400
He will play a big role in this episode,
because he will be the one to turn the tables.

00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:49.000
Good morning, Chai.

00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.800
Hello, it's Sophee.

00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:03.800
In this scene, I secretly followed Ruedee.

00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:07.960
I spied on the white house and met Kaewta.

00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:11.240
All the strong feelings of vengeance have returned.

00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:17.920
In my heart, if I went down there,
He'd be in trouble for sure.

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:22.280
I'm starting to feel the heat inside.

00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:27.440
It's also very hot right now
I haven't turned on the air conditioner either.

00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:30.560
Fight! We've come this far, we have to fight.

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:33.720
Don't forget to keep following to see what happens next.

00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:38.200
Let's go!

00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:39.160
Yes.

00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:00.400
How dare you walk all over this white house?

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:02.720
I should have walked from over there.

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:05.640
Who are you?

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:07.960
I'm the one who should be asking who you are.

00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:10.720
How dare you walk all over this white house?

00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:25.800
Chai, this is Khun Yai and P' Saen.

00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:29.840
Nice to meet you.

00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:41.640
My name is Chai. I am Ruedee's older brother,
Kaewta's close friend.

00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:45.160
I just got back from Amsterdam.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:06.200
[Poem]
It's hard to break this sorrow, impossible to break it off.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.400
[Poem]
So many things I could cut, strangely,
but cutting this love is impossible, strangely.

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.320
[Sigh]

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.720
-Oh wow, you've been thinking for so long.
-Half a day!

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.720
Stressed in this scene?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.640
Must be a relief.

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.960
This scene has a Thai verse that I have to speak.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.800
And the poems from the old days, they were like...

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:27.320
Breaking love is impossible to break off, I don't know what it is.

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:31.440
I'm the one who's going to mess it up,
so I had to practice a bit.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:35.200
Otherwise, I'd be wasting the time of Khun Phra Nai
who is sitting there "Teh Jum."

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:37.240
"Teh Jui"!

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.200
-"Teh Jui."
-"Teh Jui."

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.640
What is it, my lord? Why are you wearing a flower?

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:45.280
I feel beautiful. P' Mai told me to feel beautiful.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:47.720
-[you have a sweet face.]
-He told me to feel beautiful.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.640
-You can pull it off.
-Or...

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:54.240
Or maybe I'm... that doesn't seem right.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.960
-Is there a white envelope on the table?
-What am I?

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.040
Are you stopping again, Uncle?

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.000
If you make us stop dancing often,

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:13.440
if we don't dance fluently, you might be embarrassed in front of everyone.

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:17.360
Huh? Don't you see I have a guest?

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.240
Oh no.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.280
Did I just have a conflict with the nobles?

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.400
What did you say?

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:28.880
Having a conflict with whom?

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.000
Nothing, Ruedee.
