00:01:41.428 --> 00:01:42.349
Something's wrong.

00:01:42.508 --> 00:01:43.469
This isn't right.

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.349
This doesn't look like
the Yuexing Formation.

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:46.069
Exactly.

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:47.232
It's full of dark energy.

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:47.868
Kong Hou...

00:01:47.868 --> 00:01:49.952
If this isn't the Yuexing Formation,
then what is it?

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:51.069
What is

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.228
Master Hong Yan up to?

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:53.588
Wang Tong.

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:55.868
Legends say the Yuexing Formation

00:01:55.868 --> 00:01:57.269
should manifest a phoenix's light.

00:01:57.308 --> 00:01:58.829
Where did you hear

00:01:58.829 --> 00:01:59.588
that Hong Yan could

00:01:59.588 --> 00:02:00.749
save Kong Hou?

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:02.349
What's going on here?

00:02:02.948 --> 00:02:03.868
This halo

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:05.788
isn't just part of the formation.

00:02:05.788 --> 00:02:08.256
It's also a barrier.

00:02:08.256 --> 00:02:09.888
It doesn't matter.

00:02:09.888 --> 00:02:11.429
Let's go check it out!

00:02:43.808 --> 00:02:44.749
My love!

00:02:45.828 --> 00:02:47.168
I'll revive you now.

00:02:47.788 --> 00:02:50.349
We'll never be apart again.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.144
Kong Hou!

00:02:58.508 --> 00:02:59.948
How dare you harm my husband!

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.548
Kong Hou!

00:03:09.548 --> 00:03:10.508
Zi Chen!

00:03:11.328 --> 00:03:12.349

Kong Hou.

00:03:16.708 --> 00:03:17.629
Are you hurt?

00:03:19.228 --> 00:03:20.224
Zhong Xi.

00:03:26.848 --> 00:03:28.828
Master Jin Yue!
Let's break through the formation!

00:03:28.828 --> 00:03:30.149
The rest of you stay outside.

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:31.589
Don't act rashly.

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:32.384
- Master!
- Master!

00:03:32.384 --> 00:03:33.388
We'll join you!

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:34.788
- We can help!
- We can!

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:36.548
This formation is too dangerous.

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:37.828
Be extremely careful!

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:44.508
Master Hong Yan!

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.208
I trusted you completely.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.948
Why betray me?

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.189
I waited nearly a millennium

00:03:52.788 --> 00:03:55.828
as no one achieved ascension.

00:03:57.268 --> 00:03:58.268
When a prodigy

00:03:58.268 --> 00:04:00.224
like you finally emerged,

00:04:00.224 --> 00:04:03.776
your spiritual core shattered,
dashing all hopes.

00:04:08.508 --> 00:04:11.429
I turned to Jiusu instead,

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:13.708
planning to use

00:04:13.708 --> 00:04:15.108
his near-ascension-level core

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:16.992
to revive my husband.

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:23.588
This is all your fault!

00:04:24.989 --> 00:04:26.828
I'll kill you both!

00:06:05.908 --> 00:06:06.869
Zhong Xi!

Kong Hou.

00:06:42.028 --> 00:06:43.109
Kong Hou.

00:06:44.992 --> 00:06:46.208
- Kong Hou.
- Zhong Xi.

(300 Years Later)

00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.828
Senior Brother!

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:06.948
Who is

00:08:06.948 --> 00:08:07.808
undergoing a trial?

00:08:07.808 --> 00:08:08.789
Judging by the location,

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.148
it seems to be at Luanfeng Peak.

00:08:14.268 --> 00:08:15.708
Young Master always does this.

00:08:15.948 --> 00:08:17.268
After going through a trial,

00:08:17.268 --> 00:08:18.629
he will search the mortal realm.

00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:19.989
You're no better.

00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:21.268
He searches for her.

00:08:21.268 --> 00:08:22.268
You stalk him.

00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:23.388
And you have to

00:08:23.388 --> 00:08:24.512
follow him secretly.

00:08:25.429 --> 00:08:26.816
It's for his own good.

00:08:27.136 --> 00:08:27.708
Well,

00:08:27.989 --> 00:08:29.536
we can't let him see us

00:08:29.536 --> 00:08:31.669
being lovey-dovey.

00:08:31.669 --> 00:08:32.708
He will feel hurt.

00:08:32.708 --> 00:08:33.628
Stop it.

00:08:33.748 --> 00:08:35.168
I hate this mushy stuff.

00:08:36.069 --> 00:08:36.828
Good news.

00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:37.824
From now on,

00:08:37.888 --> 00:08:39.108
keep your distance from me.

00:08:39.348 --> 00:08:40.468
I was just joking!

00:08:40.468 --> 00:08:41.828
Don't take it seriously!

00:08:41.828 --> 00:08:42.240
I want

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.228
to be close to you.

00:08:44.069 --> 00:08:45.269
Let's go!

00:08:46.628 --> 00:08:47.309
(Don't follow me)

00:08:47.309 --> 00:08:48.708
(secretly this time.)

00:08:48.909 --> 00:08:50.149
(I'm going alone.)

00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:51.309
He set a barrier.

00:08:51.309 --> 00:08:51.988
You okay?

00:08:52.669 --> 00:08:53.789
I'm fine.

00:08:53.988 --> 00:08:54.988
Unbelievable.

00:08:55.828 --> 00:08:56.628
He thinks

00:08:56.789 --> 00:08:58.029
we don't know where he goes.

00:08:58.149 --> 00:08:59.868
After Kong Hou died,

00:08:59.868 --> 00:09:00.588
a wisp of her soul

00:09:00.588 --> 00:09:01.669
fell into the mortal realm.

00:09:01.669 --> 00:09:03.789
He's worn down the path
leading to the mortal realm.

00:09:03.789 --> 00:09:05.389
Haven't we done the same?

00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:06.304
We frequently go

00:09:06.304 --> 00:09:07.360
to the mortal realm.

00:09:11.588 --> 00:09:12.549
Zhong Xi.

00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:14.269
Master.

00:09:15.549 --> 00:09:16.828
Are you going to find her again?

00:09:17.748 --> 00:09:18.389
Yes.

00:09:18.988 --> 00:09:20.468
300 years have passed.

00:09:20.468 --> 00:09:22.468
Why can't you give up?

00:09:22.789 --> 00:09:23.808
If you don't ascend,

00:09:23.948 --> 00:09:26.228
you'll undergo trials repeatedly.

00:09:26.468 --> 00:09:27.228
The fire trial

00:09:27.228 --> 00:09:28.149
sears your body

00:09:28.149 --> 00:09:29.472
as if in refining flames.

00:09:29.588 --> 00:09:30.669
You endured

00:09:30.708 --> 00:09:32.628
the thunder strikes head-on every time.

00:09:32.628 --> 00:09:34.628
The wounds on your back...

00:09:34.628 --> 00:09:35.748
It's fine, Master.

00:09:36.228 --> 00:09:37.228
I can bear it.

00:09:37.988 --> 00:09:39.429
Besides, I've grown accustomed.

00:09:40.429 --> 00:09:42.080
Before your Master ascended,

00:09:42.309 --> 00:09:44.352
you were his deepest concern.

00:09:44.708 --> 00:09:45.868
He entrusted me

00:09:45.909 --> 00:09:47.584
to watch over you.

00:09:48.108 --> 00:09:49.309
However,

00:09:49.309 --> 00:09:51.468
I have to see you suffer endlessly.

00:09:51.669 --> 00:09:52.868
It's a shame

00:09:52.868 --> 00:09:54.228
that I let your Master down.

00:09:54.228 --> 00:09:55.189
Master.

00:09:56.069 --> 00:09:57.189
Don't say that.

00:09:57.588 --> 00:09:59.029
Over these years, your kindness

00:09:59.429 --> 00:10:00.640
has been etched in my heart.

00:10:01.988 --> 00:10:04.228
I don't want your gratitude.

00:10:04.789 --> 00:10:05.909
I want you to...

00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:07.029
Master.

00:10:07.669 --> 00:10:08.628
Without a hope

00:10:08.628 --> 00:10:09.948
in my heart,

00:10:10.348 --> 00:10:12.320
how could I endure 300 years?

00:10:12.896 --> 00:10:14.144
I dare not imagine.

00:10:15.029 --> 00:10:16.029
Perhaps

00:10:16.669 --> 00:10:17.824
I'd have perished long ago.

00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:20.309
If you never find her,

00:10:20.468 --> 00:10:21.588
perhaps she's already...

00:10:21.588 --> 00:10:22.468
No!

00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:24.509
I will find her.

00:10:24.928 --> 00:10:26.400
And bring her back.

00:10:27.789 --> 00:10:29.628
Why are you so sure?

00:10:32.748 --> 00:10:34.912
The phoenix-headed konghou still glows.

00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:38.269
She must be somewhere

00:10:39.029 --> 00:10:40.509
waiting for me to find her.

00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:44.512
Master Zhong Xi is formidable!

00:10:44.628 --> 00:10:46.708
His barrier's impenetrable!

00:10:46.948 --> 00:10:47.708
Brat!

00:10:47.708 --> 00:10:48.224
Your mother

00:10:48.224 --> 00:10:49.309
and I are trapped here!

00:10:49.309 --> 00:10:50.789
If you're so skilled, free us!

00:10:58.309 --> 00:10:59.549
300 years later,

00:10:59.669 --> 00:11:00.708
Master Zhong Xi's barrier

00:11:00.708 --> 00:11:01.789
still holds us.

00:11:01.789 --> 00:11:02.656
You're both fools!

00:11:02.789 --> 00:11:03.264
You...

00:11:03.264 --> 00:11:04.549
Then tell me.

00:11:04.549 --> 00:11:05.828
How did you learn

00:11:05.828 --> 00:11:06.789
to break this barrier?

00:11:06.789 --> 00:11:08.228
I'm a prodigy!

00:11:08.708 --> 00:11:10.189
Prodigy?

00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:13.189
You

00:11:13.189 --> 00:11:13.760
stay here

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.069
and wait for our return.

00:11:15.069 --> 00:11:16.069
Just wait.

00:11:17.108 --> 00:11:18.669
You're abandoning me?

00:11:18.669 --> 00:11:20.352
You value romantic love over your son?

00:11:20.352 --> 00:11:21.708
Aren't you a prodigy?

00:11:21.708 --> 00:11:22.789
Study hard!

00:11:27.309 --> 00:11:28.948
- Impressive!
- Impressive!

00:11:28.988 --> 00:11:30.189
So impressive!

00:11:30.588 --> 00:11:33.948
- Great!
- Great!

00:11:34.628 --> 00:11:35.988
- So impressive!
- Great.

00:11:37.868 --> 00:11:40.988
- Great!
- Great!

00:11:43.228 --> 00:11:44.224

00:11:45.309 --> 00:11:46.272
(Where)

00:11:47.149 --> 00:11:48.429
(are you?)

00:12:08.149 --> 00:12:09.389
Let me feed you.

00:13:13.549 --> 00:13:14.628
Kong Hou?

00:13:33.228 --> 00:13:34.336
Are you addressing me?

00:13:36.828 --> 00:13:38.880
How do you know my name?

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:41.309
Young master,

00:13:41.468 --> 00:13:43.149
have you mistaken me?

00:13:44.189 --> 00:13:45.348
You don't remember me?

00:13:45.868 --> 00:13:47.149
Young Master,

00:13:47.309 --> 00:13:49.149
the way you hit on a lady

00:13:49.309 --> 00:13:51.348
is outdated and too cheesy.

00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:54.149
Do better next time.

00:13:54.149 --> 00:13:55.168
No lady nowadays

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:56.309
appreciates that way.

00:14:01.628 --> 00:14:02.828
I am Zhong Xi.

00:14:04.108 --> 00:14:05.549
How could you forget?

00:14:05.549 --> 00:14:07.948
Hey, let go!

00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:08.948
I don't

00:14:08.948 --> 00:14:10.909
know you at all.

00:14:16.108 --> 00:14:16.988
I get it.

00:14:18.468 --> 00:14:19.988
You've forgotten everything.

00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:21.468
It's okay.

00:14:21.628 --> 00:14:22.868
I'll help you remember.

00:14:24.588 --> 00:14:25.588
Officers!

00:14:25.748 --> 00:14:26.909
There's a madman here!

00:14:26.988 --> 00:14:28.029
Help me quickly!

00:14:36.108 --> 00:14:36.768
Young Master

00:14:36.768 --> 00:14:38.189
just saw Kong Hou?

00:14:38.348 --> 00:14:39.776
I couldn't see clearly.

00:14:40.149 --> 00:14:41.269
But Master Zhong Xi

00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:42.429
can't mistake her like that.

00:14:42.588 --> 00:14:43.708
Kong Hou

00:14:43.708 --> 00:14:45.389
only retains a wisp of her soul.

00:14:45.549 --> 00:14:46.669
The hope of finding her

00:14:46.669 --> 00:14:47.828
is slim to begin with.

00:14:48.108 --> 00:14:50.509
What if he misses Kong Hou so much

00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:51.389
that he mistook her?

00:14:58.909 --> 00:15:00.468
He's such a strange man,

00:15:00.628 --> 00:15:02.108
though he's rather handsome.

00:15:03.789 --> 00:15:05.309
It's all his fault.

00:15:06.228 --> 00:15:08.269
I forgot to take the storybook.

00:15:08.988 --> 00:15:11.868
Has he already left?

00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:14.149
Anyway,

00:15:14.708 --> 00:15:15.628
I must

00:15:15.628 --> 00:15:17.029
obtain that storybook.

00:15:46.468 --> 00:15:47.108
(In this world,)

00:15:47.108 --> 00:15:48.704
(no two people could be so alike.)

00:15:50.228 --> 00:15:52.549
(The Memory-Severing Technique
made her forget everything?)

00:15:54.144 --> 00:15:55.520
(The Tale of Celestial Beings)

00:15:56.868 --> 00:15:58.628
(She might like this storybook.)

00:16:06.176 --> 00:16:07.648
(The Tale of Celestial Beings)

00:16:10.108 --> 00:16:11.468
Why is it you again?

00:16:12.468 --> 00:16:13.549
Kong Hou.

00:16:18.029 --> 00:16:19.040
Where has he gone?

00:16:19.708 --> 00:16:22.389
- What if he truly...?
- Stop your nonsense!

00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:23.708
Don't you know him?

00:16:23.708 --> 00:16:25.389
He won't give up

00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:26.429
until he finds Kong Hou.

00:16:26.429 --> 00:16:27.069
Moreover,

00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:28.909
he's not a child. He won't get lost.

00:16:29.909 --> 00:16:30.752
You're right.

00:16:33.909 --> 00:16:35.309
You stalker!

00:16:35.309 --> 00:16:36.549
You've followed me for a while.

00:16:36.549 --> 00:16:37.708
What exactly do you want?

00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:39.669
I'm not following you.

00:16:39.789 --> 00:16:41.108
I'm here to buy books too.

00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:46.048
I saw this book first.

00:16:46.468 --> 00:16:47.389
Hand it over!

00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:53.309
How much for this?

00:16:54.828 --> 00:16:55.588
30 copper coins.

00:16:56.029 --> 00:16:57.309
That's pricey!

00:16:57.669 --> 00:16:59.149
Can't you lower the price?

00:16:59.149 --> 00:17:00.549
This is the best-selling storybook

00:17:00.549 --> 00:17:01.988
in my shop.

00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:03.628
Impossible to buy it elsewhere.

00:17:03.748 --> 00:17:04.628
We've only got

00:17:04.628 --> 00:17:05.908
this last copy remaining.

00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:07.388
Resell it later,

00:17:07.428 --> 00:17:08.828
and you'll quadruple your money.

00:17:12.749 --> 00:17:14.188
I'll take it.

00:17:14.628 --> 00:17:16.188
I also want this book.

00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:18.144
But I want it more.

00:17:18.868 --> 00:17:19.908
I have an idea.

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:21.229
We'll both recite

00:17:21.229 --> 00:17:22.428
the contents of this book.

00:17:22.588 --> 00:17:24.469
Whoever knows it better gets the book.

00:17:26.029 --> 00:17:29.188
It's about a depraved immortal

00:17:29.309 --> 00:17:30.549
who cruelly imprisons

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:32.309
a pear blossom sprite.

00:17:34.148 --> 00:17:35.668
I'm exhausted!

00:17:35.749 --> 00:17:37.348
- Can we sit inside?
- Let's rest.

00:17:39.749 --> 00:17:40.309
Look!

00:17:41.428 --> 00:17:42.668
Hide!

00:17:45.069 --> 00:17:47.668
The sprite trains diligently,

00:17:47.668 --> 00:17:49.828
escapes to some miniature kingdom,

00:17:50.469 --> 00:17:53.108
and marries a member
of the royal family.

00:17:54.108 --> 00:17:56.069
I'm keeping this book, anyway!

00:17:57.632 --> 00:17:58.908
Ouch.

00:17:58.908 --> 00:17:59.872
Look,

00:17:59.872 --> 00:18:01.509
will his approach work?

00:18:01.628 --> 00:18:03.348
He's made Kong Hou angry.

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:04.544
He is so inarticulate.

00:18:04.544 --> 00:18:05.628
I'm frustrated for him!

00:18:05.628 --> 00:18:06.588
Don't worry.

00:18:06.709 --> 00:18:07.388
Young Master

00:18:07.388 --> 00:18:08.709
has his own strategies.

00:18:08.949 --> 00:18:11.269
I'll tell you one last time.

00:18:11.309 --> 00:18:13.344
I don't know you.

00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:14.628
You are

00:18:14.628 --> 00:18:16.269
good-looking,

00:18:16.269 --> 00:18:17.509
but you're not honest.

00:18:17.628 --> 00:18:20.108
Why choose to be a deceiver?

00:18:20.309 --> 00:18:21.828
I'm not lying to you!

00:18:23.668 --> 00:18:24.949
I'll prove it.

00:18:26.509 --> 00:18:27.936
(Her soul is indeed incomplete.)

00:18:28.588 --> 00:18:29.388
(She's already lost)

00:18:29.388 --> 00:18:30.949
(all her memories in Lingyou Realm.)

00:18:31.989 --> 00:18:33.628
Wh-What are you doing?

00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:35.628
Mind your manners!

00:18:35.628 --> 00:18:36.469
It seems

00:18:36.469 --> 00:18:37.696
you're not just a liar,

00:18:37.908 --> 00:18:40.188
but also a shameless man!

00:18:40.388 --> 00:18:41.388
Listen carefully.

00:18:41.388 --> 00:18:42.588
Don't follow me anymore!

00:18:46.949 --> 00:18:47.828
Come on.

00:18:48.229 --> 00:18:49.188
Kong Hou.

00:18:49.469 --> 00:18:50.309
Young Master.

00:18:50.469 --> 00:18:51.348
Wh-What's going on?

00:18:51.348 --> 00:18:52.188
That's Kong Hou!

00:18:52.188 --> 00:18:53.029
How is she?

00:18:53.069 --> 00:18:54.509
I just saw you two arguing.

00:18:54.588 --> 00:18:56.108
I'll make her remember.

00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:01.469
Has anyone ever

00:19:01.469 --> 00:19:02.229
told him

00:19:02.229 --> 00:19:04.668
that stalking girls like this
makes him repulsive?

00:19:05.348 --> 00:19:06.108
Nobody has.

00:19:06.428 --> 00:19:07.168
Anyway,

00:19:07.232 --> 00:19:09.184
destined lovers
will hold their happiness.

00:19:21.949 --> 00:19:22.588
Please.

00:19:23.749 --> 00:19:25.309
Why are you still following me?

00:19:25.469 --> 00:19:27.029
This is my last warning.

00:19:27.188 --> 00:19:29.216
If you don't keep your distance,

00:19:29.216 --> 00:19:30.400
I'll make you regret it.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.789
I mean no harm.

00:19:31.949 --> 00:19:32.868
Well...

00:19:33.828 --> 00:19:35.388
(Since she loves storybooks...)

00:19:37.069 --> 00:19:38.188
Well...

00:19:39.868 --> 00:19:41.069
To be honest,

00:19:41.069 --> 00:19:42.789
I'm a storybook connoisseur.

00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:45.229
Your recitation of that story
was not good

00:19:45.229 --> 00:19:46.709
and clearly missed the depth.

00:19:46.749 --> 00:19:47.828
Since

00:19:47.828 --> 00:19:48.428
we both

00:19:48.428 --> 00:19:49.760
love storybooks,

00:19:49.949 --> 00:19:51.269
we can share perspectives.

00:19:51.269 --> 00:19:52.029
I have storybooks

00:19:52.029 --> 00:19:52.628
you never read.

00:19:52.628 --> 00:19:53.269
Enough!

00:19:53.269 --> 00:19:55.360
Who said I like storybooks?

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.832
You

00:19:56.989 --> 00:19:58.229
invent any excuse

00:19:58.229 --> 00:20:00.269
to approach me.

00:20:01.269 --> 00:20:02.668
Let me tell you the truth.

00:20:03.269 --> 00:20:04.469
I resell storybooks

00:20:04.469 --> 00:20:06.749
for profit. Nothing more.

00:20:06.868 --> 00:20:07.549
You and I don't

00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:08.668
have the same passion.

00:20:08.908 --> 00:20:11.309
You'd better stay away from me.

00:20:11.469 --> 00:20:12.989
Stop ruining my business.

00:20:21.749 --> 00:20:22.428
Madam!

00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:23.709
What's the meaning of this?

00:20:24.868 --> 00:20:25.828
Mark my words.

00:20:26.229 --> 00:20:27.148
Consider this

00:20:27.148 --> 00:20:29.108
a friendly warning.

00:20:29.469 --> 00:20:31.469
No rent by tomorrow?

00:20:31.628 --> 00:20:32.749
Get out!

00:21:00.148 --> 00:21:01.188
Let me help.

00:21:07.709 --> 00:21:08.709
You are

00:21:08.949 --> 00:21:10.069
having a hard life.

00:21:11.509 --> 00:21:13.600
My foster grandfather died.

00:21:14.069 --> 00:21:15.029
The landlord...

00:21:15.989 --> 00:21:17.469
It's not your fault.

00:21:17.949 --> 00:21:19.108
You're doing your best.

00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:20.949
Why can't heaven

00:21:21.108 --> 00:21:22.148
grant me

00:21:22.148 --> 00:21:23.392
one shred of mercy?

00:21:24.108 --> 00:21:25.309
A better life awaits you

00:21:25.309 --> 00:21:26.229
beyond this hard time.

00:21:29.568 --> 00:21:31.749
You again?

00:21:31.868 --> 00:21:32.989
How dare you track me

00:21:32.989 --> 00:21:34.229
to my own home!

00:21:35.989 --> 00:21:37.388
- What are you up to?
- I...

00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:38.509
Speak.

00:21:38.509 --> 00:21:39.428
Calm down.

00:21:39.428 --> 00:21:40.989
Now I understand why.

00:21:41.188 --> 00:21:42.549
In this lifetime,

00:21:42.668 --> 00:21:44.069
Kong Hou's endured great suffering.

00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:45.989
Yet she remains hopeful.

00:21:46.148 --> 00:21:47.908
They say

00:21:48.069 --> 00:21:49.549
resilient souls

00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:50.908
are always lucky.

00:21:51.588 --> 00:21:52.469
So,

00:21:52.469 --> 00:21:53.628
I believe

00:21:53.628 --> 00:21:55.069
they will be happy.

00:21:55.069 --> 00:21:55.989
Besides,

00:21:55.989 --> 00:21:57.188
Master Zhong Xi

00:21:57.188 --> 00:21:58.949
found her after all.

00:21:59.108 --> 00:22:00.188
Isn't that comforting?

00:22:00.348 --> 00:22:01.428
But Kong Hou

00:22:01.428 --> 00:22:02.709
lost all her memories.

00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:04.549
Why do I feel

00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:05.184
this is a trial

00:22:05.184 --> 00:22:06.628
for them?

00:22:07.069 --> 00:22:09.024
Where there's a will, there's a way.

00:22:09.348 --> 00:22:10.229
Besides,

00:22:10.229 --> 00:22:11.908
I believe Master Zhong Xi

00:22:11.908 --> 00:22:13.949
will exhaust every possible method

00:22:13.949 --> 00:22:15.388
to help her remember everything.

00:22:15.549 --> 00:22:17.029
Moreover, in Kong Hou's heart,

00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:18.868
there must still be Master Zhong Xi.

00:22:19.509 --> 00:22:20.469
You're absolutely right.

00:22:20.628 --> 00:22:21.908
Calm down.

00:22:21.908 --> 00:22:22.428
Stop!

00:22:22.428 --> 00:22:22.976
Stop!

00:22:25.148 --> 00:22:26.029
Listen to me.

00:22:26.428 --> 00:22:27.989
I truly understand now.

00:22:28.229 --> 00:22:29.949
You resell storybooks

00:22:30.069 --> 00:22:31.509
because you need money.

00:22:31.989 --> 00:22:33.216
If so, I can help you.

00:22:33.216 --> 00:22:33.749
I'm serious.

00:22:33.749 --> 00:22:34.880
I don't want your help!

00:22:34.944 --> 00:22:36.668
I have limbs.

00:22:36.668 --> 00:22:37.908
I can earn money on my own.

00:22:37.908 --> 00:22:38.528
Besides,

00:22:38.709 --> 00:22:40.108
nothing in this world comes free.

00:22:40.108 --> 00:22:41.269
Who knows what schemes

00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:42.709
you're plotting in your mind?

00:22:42.709 --> 00:22:44.148
I'm someone with principles.

00:22:44.309 --> 00:22:45.824
I can earn money on my own.

00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:47.709
I have my own aspirations.

00:22:47.709 --> 00:22:48.628
Get out of here!

00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:51.668
Young Master waited three centuries.

00:22:51.828 --> 00:22:52.640
I'm certain

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.868
he won't give up this time.

00:22:54.148 --> 00:22:54.789
Exactly.

00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:55.989
Didn't you say it yourself?

00:22:56.388 --> 00:22:58.400
Destined lovers will

00:22:58.588 --> 00:23:01.388
hold their happiness.

00:23:01.388 --> 00:23:03.136
Sure, I said that,

00:23:03.136 --> 00:23:04.469
but I talked about us.

00:23:04.469 --> 00:23:05.749
Such wonderful words

00:23:05.749 --> 00:23:06.368
can't be used

00:23:06.368 --> 00:23:07.388
on the two of them.

00:23:08.108 --> 00:23:09.949
Since when did you
become so smooth-tongued?

00:23:09.949 --> 00:23:11.104
What are you talking about?

00:23:11.168 --> 00:23:12.188
As we know,

00:23:12.188 --> 00:23:13.229
well,

00:23:13.229 --> 00:23:14.588
a clumsy man

00:23:14.668 --> 00:23:15.709
can't find himself a wife.

00:23:15.709 --> 00:23:16.908
I truly wish Young Master

00:23:16.908 --> 00:23:17.828
would learn from me.

00:23:18.428 --> 00:23:20.789
- Good for you.
- It hurts!

00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:22.304
- You feel hurt?
- Seriously.

00:23:22.304 --> 00:23:22.828
Save it.

00:23:22.828 --> 00:23:24.509
You're thick-skinned, after all.

00:23:24.868 --> 00:23:26.229
Stop talking.

00:23:26.336 --> 00:23:26.989
Stop.

00:23:26.989 --> 00:23:27.709
Stop.

00:23:29.309 --> 00:23:30.029
Well,

00:23:30.428 --> 00:23:31.668
you didn't finish speaking.

00:23:32.108 --> 00:23:33.229
What do you want to do?

00:23:33.469 --> 00:23:34.720
What I want to do

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.989
is none of your business!

00:23:36.029 --> 00:23:37.029
Moreover,

00:23:37.108 --> 00:23:40.269
I know nothing about you.

00:23:40.469 --> 00:23:41.789
I don't trust you one bit!

00:23:42.348 --> 00:23:43.509
Then tell me,

00:23:43.828 --> 00:23:44.908
what must I do

00:23:44.908 --> 00:23:46.108
to earn your trust?

00:23:46.588 --> 00:23:48.828
(This guy seems a bit silly.)

00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:51.072
(Though I don't know what he is up to,)

00:23:51.509 --> 00:23:52.928
(maybe I can test him with this.)

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.816
(Even if it reveals nothing,)

00:23:55.008 --> 00:23:56.388
(it'll be fun to mess with him.)

00:23:57.428 --> 00:23:58.188
Here's the deal.

00:23:58.709 --> 00:24:01.108
If you

00:24:01.108 --> 00:24:02.388
clean my house,

00:24:03.148 --> 00:24:04.388
then

00:24:04.832 --> 00:24:06.069
I might

00:24:06.069 --> 00:24:07.904
start trusting you

00:24:07.904 --> 00:24:09.148
just a tiny bit.

00:24:09.388 --> 00:24:09.908
Deal.

00:24:10.148 --> 00:24:11.148
Tell me then.

00:24:11.709 --> 00:24:13.108
Should I organize these,

00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:14.828
sweep away the dust,

00:24:14.949 --> 00:24:16.148
or wash these items?

00:24:16.148 --> 00:24:18.989
I guess you're from a rich family.

00:24:18.989 --> 00:24:20.828
You don't seem capable of doing chores.

00:24:21.108 --> 00:24:23.269
But go ahead and try everything.

00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:24.069
Do all of it!

00:24:36.096 --> 00:24:38.309
Do you even know

00:24:38.509 --> 00:24:39.949
how to use this duster?

00:24:39.949 --> 00:24:41.348
That's not how it's used!

00:24:41.348 --> 00:24:43.108
You're supposed to flick it.

00:24:45.428 --> 00:24:46.148
I did the same.

00:24:49.188 --> 00:24:50.549
This situation

00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:52.509
feels so familiar.

00:24:52.668 --> 00:24:54.348
Like it happened before.

00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:56.800
I remember

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.348
when I dusted like this,

00:24:58.509 --> 00:25:00.229
you stood watching me.

00:25:03.749 --> 00:25:04.469
Kong Hou.

00:25:06.949 --> 00:25:08.188
Keep dusting.

00:25:08.709 --> 00:25:09.908
Make the house spotless.

00:25:09.908 --> 00:25:10.709
Got it?

00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:27.828
This guy

00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:30.949
is actually a bit simple.

00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:41.188
You wash all these sheets

00:25:41.188 --> 00:25:42.588
and fabrics.

00:25:42.588 --> 00:25:43.348
Got it.

00:25:44.069 --> 00:25:45.376
You taught me

00:25:45.376 --> 00:25:46.348
how to do laundry.

00:25:48.148 --> 00:25:50.348
I taught you?

00:25:50.509 --> 00:25:51.469
Yes.

00:25:52.628 --> 00:25:53.789
(That's indeed)

00:25:53.789 --> 00:25:55.229
(my preferred method.)

00:25:55.709 --> 00:25:57.069
(Maybe)

00:25:57.069 --> 00:25:58.868
(everyone uses this way.)

00:26:03.949 --> 00:26:05.588
Did something occur to you?

00:26:07.509 --> 00:26:08.029
I...

00:26:13.148 --> 00:26:14.949
Why are you still following me?

00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:17.509
What's special about today?

00:26:17.509 --> 00:26:18.269
Why is everyone

00:26:18.269 --> 00:26:19.348
hanging lanterns?

00:26:19.469 --> 00:26:20.509
Want to try?

00:26:21.428 --> 00:26:23.348
Save your tricks.

00:26:23.388 --> 00:26:24.749
Don't change the subject!

00:26:26.709 --> 00:26:27.668
See this?

00:26:27.709 --> 00:26:29.469
I'm a cultivator

00:26:29.668 --> 00:26:31.989
soon ascending to the Lingyou Realm.

00:26:32.148 --> 00:26:33.469
Keep following me,

00:26:33.588 --> 00:26:35.628
and you'll regret it.

00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:37.509
You know about Lingyou Realm?

00:26:37.668 --> 00:26:40.148
I read storybooks, alright?

00:26:40.309 --> 00:26:42.549
Lingyou Realm belongs to

00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:43.668
successful cultivators.

00:26:44.309 --> 00:26:45.668
Actually...

00:26:46.989 --> 00:26:48.949
I am a successful cultivator

00:26:49.108 --> 00:26:50.229
from Lingyou Realm.

00:26:50.229 --> 00:26:51.188
If you wish,

00:26:51.188 --> 00:26:52.388
I'll take you as my disciple

00:26:52.388 --> 00:26:53.348
and teach you.

00:26:54.348 --> 00:26:55.229
Please.

00:26:55.588 --> 00:26:57.348
Stop bragging!

00:26:57.628 --> 00:26:59.469
If you're from Lingyou Realm,

00:26:59.469 --> 00:27:01.069
why wander the streets

00:27:01.069 --> 00:27:02.108
like this?

00:27:02.592 --> 00:27:03.989
You should

00:27:03.989 --> 00:27:05.309
find a physician

00:27:05.309 --> 00:27:06.709
to examine your head.

00:27:06.709 --> 00:27:07.908
You don't believe me?

00:27:09.549 --> 00:27:11.029
Let me prove it to you.

00:27:17.348 --> 00:27:18.628
What's happening?

00:27:18.628 --> 00:27:20.668
Cast an immobilization spell on them.

00:27:20.989 --> 00:27:21.920
Convinced now?

00:27:22.016 --> 00:27:22.628
Well,

00:27:22.668 --> 00:27:24.029
you can't do this!

00:27:24.029 --> 00:27:24.828
It's a festival day!

00:27:24.828 --> 00:27:26.108
Release them immediately.

00:27:31.628 --> 00:27:32.384
Well?

00:27:34.029 --> 00:27:37.309
You're truly from Lingyou Realm?

00:27:37.309 --> 00:27:38.828
I never lie.

00:27:39.108 --> 00:27:41.229
Can you really take me

00:27:41.229 --> 00:27:42.309
to Lingyou Realm?

00:27:42.309 --> 00:27:44.029
My greatest virtue

00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:45.549
is keeping promises.

00:27:50.148 --> 00:27:52.029
I don't buy it, you liar!

00:27:52.128 --> 00:27:53.348
Your words

00:27:53.348 --> 00:27:55.588
would make con artists blush.

00:27:55.588 --> 00:27:56.509
You're just

00:27:56.576 --> 00:27:59.648
a charlatan playing spooky tricks.

00:27:59.648 --> 00:28:01.908
Your small tricks

00:28:02.069 --> 00:28:04.069
can't impress me.

00:28:04.069 --> 00:28:05.509
I won't be fooled.

00:28:05.668 --> 00:28:06.588
Listen carefully.

00:28:06.749 --> 00:28:07.648
Keep following me,

00:28:07.648 --> 00:28:10.348
and I'll call the guards.

00:28:15.588 --> 00:28:16.989
(Why won't she believe me?)

00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:21.229
Since that weird guy

00:28:21.428 --> 00:28:22.908
keeps haunting me,

00:28:23.108 --> 00:28:24.388
I have to hang a lantern

00:28:24.388 --> 00:28:25.408
at this late hour.

00:28:26.108 --> 00:28:27.392
I wonder

00:28:27.392 --> 00:28:28.896
if deities still listen to prayers

00:28:29.148 --> 00:28:30.749
at midnight.

00:28:35.789 --> 00:28:36.868
Can't reach it.

00:28:36.868 --> 00:28:38.388
I thought you didn't believe in this.

00:28:38.388 --> 00:28:39.136
Who's talking?

00:28:40.096 --> 00:28:41.309
You again?

00:28:41.309 --> 00:28:43.008
Haven't I made myself clear?

00:28:43.348 --> 00:28:45.148
Stop following me!

00:28:45.148 --> 00:28:46.029
If you don't leave,

00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:47.488
I'll call the guards.

00:28:47.488 --> 00:28:48.469
I'm serious.

00:28:48.469 --> 00:28:49.868
Do you need me to help you hang it?

00:28:51.868 --> 00:28:52.789
No, I don't.

00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:54.148
Stay out of this.

00:28:55.469 --> 00:28:56.588
Let me help.

00:29:02.108 --> 00:29:03.069
Make a wish.

00:29:07.069 --> 00:29:08.069
Celestial beings,

00:29:08.229 --> 00:29:10.148
wish me success in cultivation.

00:29:10.309 --> 00:29:12.469
I hope I can leave the mortal realm
and become a fairy

00:29:12.469 --> 00:29:14.304
who can eliminate demons.

00:29:14.588 --> 00:29:16.348
Let me reach the Lingyou Realm sooner.

00:29:17.908 --> 00:29:18.509
To my surprise,

00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:19.949
you're actually a cultivator.

00:29:20.069 --> 00:29:21.749
I wasn't lying to you.

00:29:21.908 --> 00:29:22.908
If you trust me,

00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:24.588
I can take you to the Lingyou Realm.

00:29:24.749 --> 00:29:26.069
You saw it yourself earlier.

00:29:26.229 --> 00:29:27.269
(Indeed.)

00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:29.428
(He did show me)

00:29:29.428 --> 00:29:30.828
(genuine skills.)

00:29:31.069 --> 00:29:31.949
(But...)

00:29:32.828 --> 00:29:33.789
It's okay.

00:29:33.989 --> 00:29:34.789
Take your time.

00:29:34.949 --> 00:29:36.188
Let me show you something.

00:29:36.188 --> 00:29:37.229
After seeing it,

00:29:37.229 --> 00:29:38.749
you decide whether to trust me.

00:29:41.709 --> 00:29:43.229
If you keep hesitating,

00:29:43.428 --> 00:29:45.269
the immortals will go to sleep.

00:29:50.709 --> 00:29:51.908
What's this?

00:29:52.069 --> 00:29:53.069
Open it.

00:29:54.148 --> 00:29:55.469
Fine, I'll look.

00:29:55.469 --> 00:29:56.768
What's there to fear?

00:30:02.944 --> 00:30:05.504
Kong Hou, happy birthday.

00:30:06.309 --> 00:30:07.509
How did you know

00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:09.309
today's my birthday?

00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:21.269
Answer me!

00:30:21.388 --> 00:30:23.488
How did you know it's my birthday?

00:30:26.069 --> 00:30:27.584
I'm an immortal.

00:30:27.584 --> 00:30:28.549
I can guess.

00:30:28.828 --> 00:30:30.229
Are you kidding me?

00:30:30.388 --> 00:30:31.648
I don't believe you.

00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.949
Try it.

00:30:33.952 --> 00:30:35.232
See how it tastes.

00:30:37.868 --> 00:30:39.069
Be honest.

00:30:39.069 --> 00:30:40.828
Did you poison this?

00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:42.080
No, I didn't.

00:30:42.628 --> 00:30:43.908
I'll eat some first.

00:30:47.949 --> 00:30:49.428
(Smells nice.)

00:30:49.428 --> 00:30:50.588
(Looks appealing.)

00:30:50.868 --> 00:30:51.588
(Whatever.)

00:30:51.588 --> 00:30:52.469
(I'm going to try it.)

00:30:58.428 --> 00:30:59.868
(Delicious.)

00:31:01.069 --> 00:31:01.789
Is it good?

00:31:04.628 --> 00:31:05.588
Just so so.

00:31:06.388 --> 00:31:07.936
Too much sugar.

00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:08.908
Overly sweet.

00:31:13.668 --> 00:31:14.709
So...

00:31:17.088 --> 00:31:18.549
Does this remind you of anything?

00:31:19.428 --> 00:31:20.989
What should I be reminded of?

00:31:21.868 --> 00:31:22.588
Well,

00:31:22.989 --> 00:31:24.709
what's your point?

00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:40.628
Want to see fireworks?

00:31:41.628 --> 00:31:43.029
Fireworks?

00:31:43.749 --> 00:31:45.828
It's a festival today.

00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:46.908
Normally,

00:31:46.908 --> 00:31:48.188
I should be out

00:31:48.188 --> 00:31:49.188
to watch fireworks.

00:31:49.188 --> 00:31:52.229
But someone

00:31:52.229 --> 00:31:53.269
kept following me.

00:31:53.388 --> 00:31:55.069
So, I had to sneak out

00:31:55.069 --> 00:31:56.828
at midnight to hang lanterns.

00:31:57.069 --> 00:31:59.108
No fireworks for us.

00:31:59.108 --> 00:32:00.668
I'll make it up to you.

00:32:10.989 --> 00:32:12.288
Fireworks!

00:32:12.388 --> 00:32:13.600
Why are you so kind to me?

00:32:14.668 --> 00:32:15.868
Isn't this good?

00:32:18.148 --> 00:32:19.388
I don't know.

00:32:19.908 --> 00:32:21.108
I only know

00:32:21.309 --> 00:32:23.360
that since my grandfather passed away,

00:32:23.789 --> 00:32:24.908
no one has

00:32:24.908 --> 00:32:26.309
remembered my birthday.

00:32:26.976 --> 00:32:28.108
Nor has anyone

00:32:28.108 --> 00:32:29.549
treated me this kindly.

00:32:35.388 --> 00:32:38.348
Can you really take me to Lingyou Realm?

00:32:38.432 --> 00:32:39.108
Yes.

00:32:57.949 --> 00:32:59.428
This is the Lingyou Realm?

00:32:59.588 --> 00:33:01.309
Yong City of Lingyou Realm.

00:33:01.709 --> 00:33:02.592
Yong City?

00:33:04.469 --> 00:33:06.108
So beautiful!

00:33:10.464 --> 00:33:11.388
Hold this.

00:33:13.348 --> 00:33:14.628
It suits you.

00:33:15.949 --> 00:33:16.628
Miss.

00:33:17.949 --> 00:33:19.148
I'll fetch the sachet.

00:33:20.032 --> 00:33:21.709
- What's happening ahead?
- I want it too!

00:33:21.709 --> 00:33:22.989
I guess the major sects

00:33:22.989 --> 00:33:24.388
are handing out red envelopes.

00:33:24.388 --> 00:33:25.440
I want it too!

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.784
Red envelopes?

00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:28.672
I got many red envelopes.

00:33:28.672 --> 00:33:29.549
Want a few?

00:33:29.709 --> 00:33:30.749
Keep them.

00:33:31.309 --> 00:33:32.469
You really

00:33:32.469 --> 00:33:34.112
have some skills.

00:33:34.749 --> 00:33:36.448
So, have you decided to learn from me?

00:33:36.749 --> 00:33:38.828
Okay, I'll do this for now.

00:33:38.828 --> 00:33:40.549
But if you teach poorly,

00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:41.760
I'll change you.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.029
Then it's settled.

00:33:43.309 --> 00:33:44.269
I haven't

00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:45.312
known your name.

00:33:46.668 --> 00:33:47.469
Zhong Xi.

00:33:48.188 --> 00:33:49.628
Zhong Xi.

00:33:49.628 --> 00:33:50.668
Which characters?

00:33:51.588 --> 00:33:52.908
Give me your hand.

00:34:03.069 --> 00:34:04.608
Zhong Xi.

00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:06.188
What's wrong?

00:34:06.828 --> 00:34:08.029
I just think

00:34:08.029 --> 00:34:09.829
the two characters are hard to write

00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:10.829
and pronounce.

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:13.069
Almost as hard as my own name.

00:34:13.628 --> 00:34:15.108
But I haven't asked you yet.

00:34:15.148 --> 00:34:16.469
In this vast world,

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:18.528
why did you specifically seek me out?

00:34:20.549 --> 00:34:21.788
Perhaps...

00:34:22.549 --> 00:34:23.509
We're meant to meet.

00:34:27.588 --> 00:34:28.668
I have something for you.

00:34:31.108 --> 00:34:31.748
Take this.

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:33.184
This is

00:34:33.184 --> 00:34:34.708
a powerful spiritual tool.

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:37.349
You'll need it for trials

00:34:37.549 --> 00:34:38.944
and cultivation.

00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:40.192
A hairpin?

00:34:41.108 --> 00:34:42.989
How does this work?

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:45.989
Can it transform into a weapon?

00:34:50.509 --> 00:34:51.840
I just imagined if it could

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.800
become a weapon.

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:54.268
It actually transformed!

00:34:54.268 --> 00:34:55.628
How obedient!

00:35:01.308 --> 00:35:02.949
Now it's a hairpin again.

00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:05.088
Because it was yours.

00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:07.748
Let's go.

00:35:08.708 --> 00:35:09.668
What will we do?

00:35:09.668 --> 00:35:10.389
Cultivate you.

00:35:11.628 --> 00:35:13.029
Then lead the way quickly.

00:35:14.029 --> 00:35:14.549
Come on.

00:35:17.869 --> 00:35:19.549
Still following him?

00:35:21.069 --> 00:35:22.272
No need.

00:35:22.469 --> 00:35:24.389
He and Kong Hou haven't met
for three centuries.

00:35:24.389 --> 00:35:25.668
Leave them alone.

00:35:26.509 --> 00:35:28.029
Such a hard-won moment.

00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:29.628
What do you mean?

00:35:29.628 --> 00:35:30.588
Look at you.

00:35:30.624 --> 00:35:31.744
You've always been worried.

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:32.949
You can finally be relieved.

00:35:33.509 --> 00:35:34.429
By the way,

00:35:34.429 --> 00:35:36.509
I've had it hardest,

00:35:36.509 --> 00:35:38.816
following you around
with pointless worries,

00:35:38.816 --> 00:35:40.069
delaying my real duties.

00:35:41.148 --> 00:35:43.228
You're the one who finds tasks tedious.

00:35:43.228 --> 00:35:44.228
You don't want to work.

00:35:44.228 --> 00:35:44.949
Be reasonable.

00:35:44.949 --> 00:35:45.869
Look,

00:35:45.869 --> 00:35:47.668
Zhaohan Sect is almost
another Yunhua Sect.

00:35:47.668 --> 00:35:49.056
What's wrong with that?

00:35:49.056 --> 00:35:49.568
It's good.

00:35:49.568 --> 00:35:50.592
You always complained

00:35:50.592 --> 00:35:51.389
that I always

00:35:51.389 --> 00:35:53.069
focused on slaying demons.

00:35:53.069 --> 00:35:54.429
Now, you complain again?

00:35:55.148 --> 00:35:56.349
When did I complain?

00:35:56.349 --> 00:35:57.349
I always support you.

00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.824
Right?

00:35:57.824 --> 00:35:58.788
- I never complain.
- Master Ling.

00:35:58.788 --> 00:35:59.869
Help me handle this.

00:35:59.869 --> 00:36:00.509
Master.

00:36:00.869 --> 00:36:01.509
Beg me.

00:36:01.788 --> 00:36:02.464
- Master.
- Just beg me.

00:36:02.464 --> 00:36:02.949
Beg me.

00:36:02.949 --> 00:36:03.748
I beg you.

00:36:03.748 --> 00:36:04.748
Why seek Master?

00:36:04.748 --> 00:36:05.588
Talk to me instead.

00:36:05.588 --> 00:36:06.429
(Yunhua Sect)
Master.

00:36:06.429 --> 00:36:07.668
When we reach Yong City,

00:36:07.668 --> 00:36:09.188
set up our usual stall first.

00:36:09.188 --> 00:36:10.148
Remember my words.

00:36:10.148 --> 00:36:11.029
Coordinate properly.

00:36:11.029 --> 00:36:11.829
Don't worry, Master.

00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:12.668
No problem.

00:36:13.108 --> 00:36:14.268
After we earn money,

00:36:14.268 --> 00:36:15.829
I'll get each of you a new hairpin.

00:36:17.268 --> 00:36:17.909
Master.

00:36:17.949 --> 00:36:19.029
I want the same hairpin

00:36:19.029 --> 00:36:20.389
Bi Yue wears.

00:36:20.628 --> 00:36:21.389
No problem.

00:36:21.748 --> 00:36:23.509
Ling Hui!

00:36:24.188 --> 00:36:25.108
Master Tan Feng

00:36:25.108 --> 00:36:26.308
needs you not to go out today.

00:36:26.308 --> 00:36:28.416
New disciple initiation ceremony
is about to start.

00:36:28.416 --> 00:36:30.268
Please go to the main hall
to assist with it.

00:36:30.268 --> 00:36:31.668
Can't I keep my money-making hobby?

00:36:31.668 --> 00:36:32.949
Why must he meddle?

00:36:33.148 --> 00:36:34.228
Had I known this,

00:36:34.228 --> 00:36:34.788
I should have

00:36:34.788 --> 00:36:36.268
sent him off to ascend too.

00:36:44.668 --> 00:36:45.748
It really is her.

00:36:46.389 --> 00:36:47.776
She's really Kong Hou, right?

00:36:48.704 --> 00:36:50.349
No mistake. It's definitely her.

00:36:50.708 --> 00:36:51.392
I even

00:36:51.424 --> 00:36:53.228
smell her familiar scent.

00:36:58.628 --> 00:37:00.148
Yes, she is Kong Hou!

00:37:04.429 --> 00:37:05.788
Is this the perfect place

00:37:05.788 --> 00:37:07.488
you mentioned for my cultivation?

00:37:11.788 --> 00:37:14.228
I feel something's off about this place.

00:37:15.549 --> 00:37:16.668
What's strange about it?

00:37:16.989 --> 00:37:19.788
Anyway, I don't want
to cultivate myself here.

00:37:19.989 --> 00:37:21.708
Didn't you say I could choose?

00:37:21.708 --> 00:37:23.588
Then it needs to satisfy me.

00:37:23.788 --> 00:37:25.389
Let's find another spot.

00:37:26.429 --> 00:37:27.029
Fine.

00:37:33.909 --> 00:37:35.429
There's even a swing here.

00:37:35.488 --> 00:37:36.869
So beautiful.

00:37:45.909 --> 00:37:47.148
What are you thinking about?

00:37:48.668 --> 00:37:49.389
Nothing.

00:37:54.949 --> 00:37:56.748
You're clearly hiding something.

00:38:00.989 --> 00:38:02.148
Do you remember this?

00:38:02.349 --> 00:38:03.148
No.

00:38:06.788 --> 00:38:07.588
Forget it.

00:38:10.509 --> 00:38:11.429
I understand now.

00:38:11.469 --> 00:38:14.588
You make your living selling jade.

00:38:14.588 --> 00:38:15.909
You're a jade trader.

00:38:17.909 --> 00:38:18.748
It's okay.

00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:21.069
We can start fresh.

00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:22.148
Start what?

00:38:23.509 --> 00:38:25.148
You'll begin teaching me now?

00:38:25.989 --> 00:38:27.469
Do you like this place?

00:38:27.708 --> 00:38:29.108
I can teach you here.

00:38:29.188 --> 00:38:29.869
How about it?

00:38:31.188 --> 00:38:32.949
This place is just okay.

00:38:32.949 --> 00:38:34.588
I want to check other places.

00:38:39.628 --> 00:38:40.549
Zhong Xi.

00:38:40.549 --> 00:38:41.869
What kind of place is this?

00:38:49.788 --> 00:38:50.748
Let's go in.

00:38:56.469 --> 00:38:57.268
Zhong Xi.

00:38:57.268 --> 00:38:58.349
I love this place.

00:38:58.549 --> 00:38:59.708
I want to live here.

00:39:00.148 --> 00:39:01.268
You love this place?

00:39:02.668 --> 00:39:04.069
(Perhaps those days)

00:39:04.708 --> 00:39:06.668
(left equally indelible marks on her,)

00:39:07.308 --> 00:39:08.909
(so she chose this place.)

00:39:09.469 --> 00:39:10.628
I'm glad you like it.

00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:11.829
Then it's your place.

00:39:41.788 --> 00:39:43.308
How did you do this?

00:39:43.308 --> 00:39:45.069
If you learn seriously from me,

00:39:45.069 --> 00:39:46.069
you'll do this too.

00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.829
Rest assured,

00:39:46.829 --> 00:39:48.509
I'll study hard.

00:39:48.509 --> 00:39:49.949
Then I'll gift you an abode

00:39:49.949 --> 00:39:51.628
like this too.

00:39:52.108 --> 00:39:52.989
Deal.

00:39:53.588 --> 00:39:55.389
I always keep my word.

00:39:55.469 --> 00:39:56.148
Come on.

00:39:56.308 --> 00:39:57.308
Let's pinky swear.

00:39:57.469 --> 00:39:59.228
I promise.

00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:02.708
Pinky swear.

00:40:02.949 --> 00:40:03.829
Done.

00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:05.349
No take-backs.

00:40:07.708 --> 00:40:09.344
No take-backs forever.

00:40:12.228 --> 00:40:13.748
Good. It's settled then.

00:40:13.949 --> 00:40:14.949
But remember,

00:40:15.389 --> 00:40:16.869
don't learn

00:40:16.869 --> 00:40:18.304
from storybooks.

00:40:18.336 --> 00:40:20.188
Those books only teach you

00:40:20.188 --> 00:40:22.528
useless and hokey stuff.

00:40:23.469 --> 00:40:24.268
Okay.

00:40:24.469 --> 00:40:25.268
Got it.

00:40:25.549 --> 00:40:27.349
You rest here.

00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:28.320
I need to go out.

00:40:28.748 --> 00:40:30.668
You're not planning to abandon me

00:40:30.668 --> 00:40:32.228
after luring me here, are you?

00:40:33.389 --> 00:40:34.708
Of course not.

00:40:36.469 --> 00:40:38.708
We've promised.

00:40:39.228 --> 00:40:39.909
Alright.

00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:41.108
I trust you.

00:40:44.628 --> 00:40:46.549
When Tan Feng wrote to me yesterday,

00:40:46.549 --> 00:40:47.989
I still had doubts.

00:40:47.989 --> 00:40:49.069
Unexpectedly,

00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:50.549
you actually found her.

00:40:50.668 --> 00:40:51.389
Yes.

00:40:51.588 --> 00:40:53.989
I'll accompany her
in secluded cultivation.

00:40:54.228 --> 00:40:55.108
Okay.

00:40:55.308 --> 00:40:57.029
Three centuries later,

00:40:57.029 --> 00:40:59.108
your efforts are finally rewarded.

00:41:00.228 --> 00:41:01.588
Before your Master ascended,

00:41:01.588 --> 00:41:03.389
you were his deepest concern.

00:41:03.588 --> 00:41:05.628
Knowing you've reunited with Kong Hou,

00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:07.308
he'd put his mind at ease.

00:41:10.748 --> 00:41:11.909
Take care.

00:41:23.069 --> 00:41:23.869
You're all here.

00:41:24.509 --> 00:41:25.188
Young Master.

00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:27.029
Will you return?

00:41:28.668 --> 00:41:30.668
When I finish the seclusion

00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:31.989
with Kong Hou,

00:41:32.228 --> 00:41:33.949
you should have ascended already.

00:41:34.989 --> 00:41:36.308
It's okay.

00:41:36.509 --> 00:41:37.668
If you don't have time,

00:41:37.668 --> 00:41:38.588
we'll make time

00:41:38.588 --> 00:41:39.349
to visit you.

00:41:42.029 --> 00:41:42.848
All these years,

00:41:42.848 --> 00:41:44.228
you've stayed by my side.

00:41:44.228 --> 00:41:45.228
Thank you for that.

00:41:47.949 --> 00:41:49.788
But don't follow me anymore.

00:41:50.668 --> 00:41:51.909
And stop worrying about me.

00:41:52.949 --> 00:41:53.824
The three of you

00:41:53.824 --> 00:41:54.909
live happily together.

00:41:55.949 --> 00:41:56.869
Cultivate hard

00:41:57.108 --> 00:41:58.349
and strive for early ascension.

00:41:58.469 --> 00:41:59.108
Understood.

00:42:00.628 --> 00:42:02.628
Hey, is Master Zhong Xi really leaving?

00:42:03.268 --> 00:42:04.512
Hey what?

00:42:04.512 --> 00:42:05.308
Call me father.

00:42:05.308 --> 00:42:06.549
Behave, or I'll spank you.

00:42:06.748 --> 00:42:08.469
Enough. I'm leaving now.

00:42:14.708 --> 00:42:15.668
Take care.

00:42:28.389 --> 00:42:29.748
These are all yours.

00:42:29.909 --> 00:42:31.308
To be precise,

00:42:31.308 --> 00:42:32.708
they all belong to you.

00:42:33.549 --> 00:42:34.989
I want to take you as my disciple.

00:42:34.989 --> 00:42:36.349
These are my gifts for you.

00:42:36.788 --> 00:42:37.869
Your gifts?

00:42:38.228 --> 00:42:39.040
Shouldn't I

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.672
give you gifts instead?

00:42:41.429 --> 00:42:42.748
That doesn't matter.

00:42:43.429 --> 00:42:44.429
However,

00:42:44.429 --> 00:42:46.308
if I become your disciple,

00:42:46.308 --> 00:42:47.552
wouldn't that mean

00:42:47.552 --> 00:42:49.389
I'll have to obey you in everything?

00:42:49.628 --> 00:42:51.308
That sounds terrible.

00:42:57.429 --> 00:42:58.308
Alright then.

00:42:58.549 --> 00:43:00.389
Since you insist on giving these,

00:43:00.389 --> 00:43:01.509
I'll accept

00:43:01.509 --> 00:43:02.989
these gifts.

00:43:03.188 --> 00:43:05.108
When I achieve immortality
through cultivation,

00:43:05.108 --> 00:43:07.029
I'll give you something even better.

00:43:08.228 --> 00:43:09.869
And this

00:43:10.389 --> 00:43:11.509
is also yours.

00:43:14.829 --> 00:43:17.248
This bracelet is quite special.

00:43:17.509 --> 00:43:18.748
It's a spiritual tool.

00:43:18.909 --> 00:43:20.588
It will aid your cultivation.

00:43:22.628 --> 00:43:24.349
In short, keep all these.

00:43:24.748 --> 00:43:26.272
If you need anything else,

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.509
just tell me.

00:43:30.308 --> 00:43:32.308
There is one more thing.

00:43:35.296 --> 00:43:39.328
(Flying Up Without Disturb)

00:43:40.188 --> 00:43:41.108
Zhong Xi,

00:43:41.308 --> 00:43:42.240
look at this.

00:43:42.668 --> 00:43:43.628
What do you think?

00:43:43.628 --> 00:43:45.280
(Flying Up Without Disturb)

00:43:45.788 --> 00:43:47.389
Flying up without disturb.

00:43:47.549 --> 00:43:48.509
Excellent.

00:43:56.224 --> 00:44:00.224
