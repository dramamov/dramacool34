WEBVTT

00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:09.155
(Moon River)

00:00:09.215 --> 00:00:10.455
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

00:00:10.525 --> 00:00:11.755
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

00:00:11.825 --> 00:00:13.125
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:15.355
You...

00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:18.125
wear your flower shoes.

00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:21.595
I will be the one...

00:00:22.595 --> 00:00:23.765
running barefoot.

00:00:26.365 --> 00:00:27.535
What are you...

00:00:31.745 --> 00:00:32.745
From now on,

00:00:36.015 --> 00:00:37.785
I cannot look the other way anymore.

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:52.865
Your Royal Highness.

00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:57.065
Your Royal Highness.

00:00:58.835 --> 00:00:59.905
Your Royal Highness.

00:01:01.635 --> 00:01:04.375
Oh, no. Please wake up.

00:01:05.445 --> 00:01:07.415
- Your Royal Highness. - Your Royal Highness.

00:01:08.675 --> 00:01:09.675
Hurry.

00:01:15.585 --> 00:01:17.215
Please examine her closely.

00:01:18.655 --> 00:01:21.555
His pulse is normal, so you need not worry.

00:01:22.725 --> 00:01:23.795
But over here...

00:01:24.095 --> 00:01:25.665
What? What is it?

00:01:27.665 --> 00:01:30.805
- It seems there is drug on it. - What? Drug?

00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:34.835
If it is drug, could it be...

00:01:36.105 --> 00:01:37.235
Poison?

00:01:38.405 --> 00:01:40.275
She has simply fainted from exhaustion.

00:01:40.645 --> 00:01:43.215
I understand. You may go now.

00:02:00.095 --> 00:02:01.295
Are you awake now?

00:02:11.705 --> 00:02:14.075
- How did I end up here? - What?

00:02:14.915 --> 00:02:16.675
I was going to ask you the same thing when you got up.

00:02:16.945 --> 00:02:18.845
What am I supposed to do if you cannot remember?

00:02:19.585 --> 00:02:23.315
Explain. We were having fun, and then you suddenly stormed off.

00:02:23.415 --> 00:02:26.625
Why were you out running at night just to collapse?

00:02:30.225 --> 00:02:32.464
Let me go! No! Let go of me!

00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:34.665
Let me go! Let go!

00:02:35.565 --> 00:02:37.965
The Left State Councillor will surely harm Dal.

00:02:38.865 --> 00:02:41.205
I can protect her somehow while our bodies are swapped,

00:02:41.935 --> 00:02:43.235
but once we switch back...

00:02:44.705 --> 00:02:45.805
Darn it.

00:02:46.105 --> 00:02:47.105
What?

00:02:49.815 --> 00:02:52.785
If you will not talk, then do not. Why suddenly curse?

00:02:53.915 --> 00:02:55.685
Where are you going? You have not even recovered yet.

00:02:58.355 --> 00:02:59.485
There is only one way.

00:02:59.925 --> 00:03:01.325
Between protecting her and just standing by,

00:03:01.655 --> 00:03:02.995
I must stand in between.

00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:04.925
I have no choice but to stand there and be a coward.

00:03:07.635 --> 00:03:09.435
This must be why our bodies switched.

00:03:10.735 --> 00:03:12.065
So I would get hurt instead of you.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:16.275
So I would experience all this humiliation myself.

00:03:16.935 --> 00:03:19.105
I am never to escape the guilt I feel toward the Crown Princess.

00:03:20.815 --> 00:03:23.215
You will never know how this feels, will you?

00:03:25.215 --> 00:03:26.245
So...

00:03:27.215 --> 00:03:29.055
when we switch back, leave without a moment's hesitation.

00:03:29.415 --> 00:03:31.125
And never set foot in Hanyang again.

00:03:41.165 --> 00:03:42.934
(Mangdeok)

00:03:42.935 --> 00:03:44.035
Are you kidding me?

00:03:44.335 --> 00:03:47.005
He thinks only he is feeling awful, while I am on top of the world?

00:03:48.105 --> 00:03:51.405
So only his pride gets hurt? You think mine is still perfect?

00:03:53.275 --> 00:03:54.275
Unbelievable.

00:03:56.245 --> 00:03:57.315
This is lousy.

00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:17.735
How utterly cowardly of me.

00:04:20.465 --> 00:04:22.835
Even though I know I am the reason for all this danger,

00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:26.875
and yet, all I have done is hurt her.

00:04:27.975 --> 00:04:31.145
Can a girl get some sleep? What is your problem every night?

00:04:31.215 --> 00:04:33.185
How insolent! How dare you...

00:04:44.025 --> 00:04:45.525
I have to dodge the wooden pillow.

00:04:46.025 --> 00:04:47.225
Dodging is the best option.

00:04:54.635 --> 00:04:56.135
Why does it have to be the moon again?

00:05:03.275 --> 00:05:04.285
Right.

00:05:04.945 --> 00:05:06.385
Avoidance is the best strategy.

00:05:07.655 --> 00:05:09.085
Hiding is the best strategy.

00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:22.965
Good thing the Left State Councillor is out of the capital.

00:05:23.495 --> 00:05:25.165
If he finds out we failed today,

00:05:25.805 --> 00:05:27.105
I am a dead woman.

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:31.975
About that girl, Park Dal,

00:05:32.505 --> 00:05:33.805
bring me whatever you can find on her.

00:05:45.255 --> 00:05:49.295
Your Royal Highness. Queen Dowager is looking for you.

00:05:51.495 --> 00:05:52.765
Tell her I am busy.

00:05:53.065 --> 00:05:55.935
All she will do is lecture me about choosing a Royal Concubine.

00:05:56.365 --> 00:05:58.634
She will slam the desk in the end.

00:05:58.635 --> 00:06:00.365
What is it with these nobles...

00:06:00.435 --> 00:06:02.105
and their obsession with slamming desks?

00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:05.405
What did the desk ever do to them? Honestly.

00:06:07.275 --> 00:06:08.575
An infertility potion?

00:06:11.745 --> 00:06:14.185
So the Left State Councillor has finally crossed the line.

00:06:15.085 --> 00:06:17.155
According to my spy with the Chief Court Lady,

00:06:17.415 --> 00:06:20.355
Park Dal refused to drink the infertility potion to the end...

00:06:20.455 --> 00:06:23.895
- and fought off ten court ladies. - She fought back?

00:06:27.295 --> 00:06:29.495
The more I hear about her, the more I like her.

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:34.805
Yes. To be one of my people, one must have that kind of spirit.

00:06:36.235 --> 00:06:38.475
It seems the Chief Court Lady is about to make another move.

00:06:38.845 --> 00:06:39.975
What are your orders?

00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:44.174
If the Crown Prince is not a fool,

00:06:44.175 --> 00:06:45.745
he will know that appointing a Royal Concubine...

00:06:45.885 --> 00:06:48.115
is his only shield.

00:06:48.655 --> 00:06:51.425
If he gives me even the slightest excuse,

00:06:51.825 --> 00:06:53.255
I am issuing the appointment on the spot.

00:07:04.465 --> 00:07:06.765
This must be why our bodies switched.

00:07:07.435 --> 00:07:08.835
So I would get hurt instead of you.

00:07:11.205 --> 00:07:13.305
So I would experience all this humiliation myself.

00:07:16.945 --> 00:07:19.585
I am never to escape the guilt I feel toward the Crown Princess.

00:07:22.815 --> 00:07:25.955
I cannot eat with so many eyes on me.

00:07:26.425 --> 00:07:29.295
One court lady may stay. The rest of you are dismissed.

00:07:40.365 --> 00:07:41.435
Wait.

00:07:42.035 --> 00:07:44.275
Where is Dal? Why is she...

00:07:47.715 --> 00:07:49.614
Dal was sent to help prepare for your wedding...

00:07:49.615 --> 00:07:51.085
at the Office of Royal Wedding Rites.

00:07:58.955 --> 00:07:59.985
I am not eating.

00:08:01.095 --> 00:08:02.125
Take it away.

00:08:14.835 --> 00:08:15.835
Crown Prince.

00:08:20.405 --> 00:08:24.885
Hide well or I will see your hair

00:08:25.015 --> 00:08:29.255
Hide well or I will see your rear

00:08:29.315 --> 00:08:33.525
Where are you hiding? Behind a tree there?

00:08:33.725 --> 00:08:37.695
Hold in your laughter, if you dare

00:08:37.865 --> 00:08:42.035
Hide well or I will see your hair

00:08:42.335 --> 00:08:43.765
- Your Royal Highness! - Your Royal Highness!

00:09:00.045 --> 00:09:01.185
Crown Prince.

00:09:07.025 --> 00:09:09.025
What? His Majesty the King?

00:09:10.295 --> 00:09:12.395
Then I must go at once.

00:09:13.265 --> 00:09:15.165
Crown Prince.

00:09:15.735 --> 00:09:17.265
Darn it. That little brat.

00:09:23.775 --> 00:09:26.405
Announcing His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince.

00:09:47.865 --> 00:09:50.565
(Chapter Seven: Hide-and-Seek)

00:09:50.795 --> 00:09:52.304
It is not like I am going to eat him up.

00:09:52.305 --> 00:09:53.605
Why is he avoiding me? Why?

00:09:54.405 --> 00:09:55.534
- Well... - Why is Prince Je Un...

00:09:55.535 --> 00:09:56.705
not getting better?

00:09:57.775 --> 00:10:01.275
He is a nobleman with every comfort. Why is he not recovering?

00:10:01.415 --> 00:10:02.445
Darn it.

00:10:02.815 --> 00:10:05.045
What about the talks for the Gyesa Year Incident?

00:10:05.315 --> 00:10:08.385
If you are that concerned, why not send the Royal Physician?

00:10:11.015 --> 00:10:12.985
- I can do that? - Yes.

00:10:15.055 --> 00:10:17.225
Why would he suddenly send the Royal Physician?

00:10:17.695 --> 00:10:19.995
You do not think he has realised you are faking it, do you?

00:10:20.425 --> 00:10:21.965
No, I do not think that is it.

00:10:22.395 --> 00:10:25.305
But it is clear he wants to resolve the Gyesa Year Incident quickly.

00:10:28.175 --> 00:10:31.345
In this situation, if he finds out about the boy from Qing...

00:10:32.305 --> 00:10:35.145
He will charge full steam ahead. What else can we do but run for it?

00:10:35.545 --> 00:10:38.645
That boy from Qing is running wild, demanding immediate revenge.

00:10:39.915 --> 00:10:43.255
Do not follow me today. I need you to watch him closely.

00:10:43.585 --> 00:10:44.585
Yes, sir.

00:10:54.295 --> 00:10:57.165
Please. If I can just hold out until the Royal Wedding,

00:10:57.465 --> 00:10:59.905
I can stop U Hui from being enslaved.

00:11:01.065 --> 00:11:04.335
Even if it makes me a coward, there is no other way.

00:11:45.585 --> 00:11:46.615
I will be off then.

00:11:47.885 --> 00:11:49.214
You cannot get out of it this time.

00:11:49.215 --> 00:11:51.455
They say Prince Je Un is fully recovered.

00:11:53.055 --> 00:11:56.055
Right. Who knows when our bodies will switch back?

00:11:56.295 --> 00:11:58.195
I cannot just keep putting off my revenge.

00:11:59.095 --> 00:12:00.125
All right.

00:12:00.725 --> 00:12:01.735
Let us go.

00:12:15.345 --> 00:12:19.285
There are no holes in the cover I created. Got it?

00:12:29.355 --> 00:12:30.395
Tie this for me.

00:12:36.365 --> 00:12:37.695
Hey, Eunuch Yoon.

00:12:38.865 --> 00:12:40.305
Go tie His Royal Highness's hat string.

00:13:02.125 --> 00:13:04.055
- Se Dol. - Yes?

00:13:04.155 --> 00:13:07.125
Do you know what you call gold floating on water?

00:13:07.195 --> 00:13:08.965
Why are you asking something so out of the blue?

00:13:09.835 --> 00:13:11.164
- Exactly! - What is?

00:13:11.165 --> 00:13:12.665
Gold floating on water. It is "out of the blue."

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:16.175
Gold floating... "Out of the blue." That is so lame.

00:13:21.105 --> 00:13:23.545
You laughed, right You just laughed, right?

00:13:29.785 --> 00:13:30.985
Something went down the wrong pipe.

00:13:42.335 --> 00:13:44.805
It was not me. It was His Royal Highness.

00:13:49.075 --> 00:13:52.045
Fine, it was me. So what?

00:13:54.675 --> 00:13:56.045
What do you mean, "so what"?

00:13:58.515 --> 00:14:00.115
We are running late. We need to go.

00:14:16.435 --> 00:14:18.435
Why is Dal here?

00:14:20.905 --> 00:14:24.504
From now on, Dal will be helping with the Gyesa Year Incident.

00:14:24.505 --> 00:14:27.045
By any chance, is the reason Dal is here...

00:14:27.305 --> 00:14:29.275
related to your feelings for her?

00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:33.545
Feelings? Do not be ridiculous.

00:14:35.215 --> 00:14:36.515
Me neither, you know.

00:14:38.425 --> 00:14:40.225
Who said it did?

00:14:41.185 --> 00:14:44.725
Why do you not stop prying and tell us your news from Qing?

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:57.435
I believe the Jimjo Birdy owner's son is alive.

00:15:00.205 --> 00:15:03.175
This will be the one and only time I lie.

00:15:09.855 --> 00:15:12.425
Based on his age, the burn scars, and how the old man from Qing...

00:15:12.485 --> 00:15:15.525
suddenly moved after the fire in the Year of Imjin,

00:15:15.925 --> 00:15:19.365
I suspect the old man's son is the son of the Jimjo's owner.

00:15:24.235 --> 00:15:25.305
That makes sense.

00:15:25.565 --> 00:15:28.275
Then why do we not bring him here right now?

00:15:29.305 --> 00:15:31.674
This letter says he is missing.

00:15:31.675 --> 00:15:33.705
It is going to take time to find him.

00:15:36.845 --> 00:15:38.415
If we can just find this son,

00:15:38.985 --> 00:15:41.115
this could all be resolved quite easily.

00:15:42.285 --> 00:15:43.285
Perhaps...

00:15:43.955 --> 00:15:46.385
we could even take down the Left State Councillor before the wedding.

00:15:46.925 --> 00:15:49.295
Even though you clearly cannot stand me,

00:15:49.695 --> 00:15:51.325
I guess you plan on cancelling the Royal Wedding.

00:15:52.395 --> 00:15:55.095
Is she the one in the Royal Wedding?

00:15:55.235 --> 00:15:56.435
What?

00:15:58.735 --> 00:16:01.005
No, I mean... Me.

00:16:01.675 --> 00:16:02.875
I am talking about me.

00:16:03.135 --> 00:16:04.905
I am the one who plans on calling off the Royal Wedding.

00:16:04.975 --> 00:16:07.845
What do you mean you are not going through with the Royal Wedding?

00:16:12.715 --> 00:16:14.915
It is just that, no matter how I look at it...

00:16:15.785 --> 00:16:17.354
- it just does not make... - Gang.

00:16:17.355 --> 00:16:18.385
Come on.

00:16:18.755 --> 00:16:21.595
Are you not counting your chickens before they hatch?

00:16:21.925 --> 00:16:24.325
You have to find the son of the Jimjo's owner...

00:16:24.625 --> 00:16:27.124
and use his proof to catch the Left State Councillor.

00:16:27.125 --> 00:16:28.595
That is the only way.

00:16:29.195 --> 00:16:32.765
The Royal Wedding is in a month. Can you really do all that by then?

00:16:33.065 --> 00:16:34.705
Why do you have to rain on our parade...

00:16:37.435 --> 00:16:40.705
You lied to me? Why did you hide the fact that I am here?

00:16:42.415 --> 00:16:45.415
- Let us go outside. We can talk... - What is he talking about?

00:16:46.185 --> 00:16:47.415
What does he mean, you hid his existence?

00:16:48.555 --> 00:16:51.585
Gang. You understand the Qing language?

00:16:52.225 --> 00:16:53.255
Well...

00:16:53.925 --> 00:16:54.995
I picked some up here and there.

00:16:55.795 --> 00:16:58.155
Where is the man who raised the Jimjo?

00:16:58.325 --> 00:17:01.695
Soon after selling the bird, a fire killed his entire family.

00:17:01.865 --> 00:17:04.135
Apparently, all his Jimjo Birds were also destroyed in the blaze.

00:17:17.075 --> 00:17:18.815
So he is the son of the bird's owner?

00:17:21.215 --> 00:17:23.715
- That is... - Let me go.

00:17:28.455 --> 00:17:29.825
You have some explaining to do.

00:17:33.325 --> 00:17:36.135
I will explain. I can explain everything.

00:17:50.975 --> 00:17:52.045
I am sure.

00:17:53.385 --> 00:17:55.155
After all, what right does a man who betrayed us for a woman...

00:17:55.555 --> 00:17:57.985
- have to say anything? - Dal!

00:17:58.015 --> 00:17:59.685
Is it true? Did you betray us for the Crown Princess Consort?

00:17:59.925 --> 00:18:01.995
Or is there another reason?

00:18:06.395 --> 00:18:07.925
You knew?

00:18:08.365 --> 00:18:10.734
His Royal Highness has known...

00:18:10.735 --> 00:18:12.565
about you and the Crown Princess Consort for a long time.

00:18:12.765 --> 00:18:14.065
Say something.

00:18:15.005 --> 00:18:16.505
Just give me any excuse.

00:18:24.045 --> 00:18:25.145
I have no excuse.

00:18:30.185 --> 00:18:31.415
As of today,

00:18:31.955 --> 00:18:34.555
you are now off the Gyesa Year Incident case.

00:18:35.595 --> 00:18:38.925
Take this boy from Qing. Take him in for questioning.

00:18:39.125 --> 00:18:40.795
Why would you order that, Lady Park?

00:18:44.065 --> 00:18:45.335
Take the boy away.

00:18:46.035 --> 00:18:47.035
Yes, Your Highness.

00:19:10.695 --> 00:19:12.995
Wait a minute. I am going with you.

00:19:13.125 --> 00:19:15.865
If the Left State Councillor learns of the Qing boy, he will kill him.

00:19:16.095 --> 00:19:17.165
Send him to Unjeong Palace.

00:19:17.435 --> 00:19:19.965
It was my private residence, so it should be a safe place.

00:19:20.865 --> 00:19:24.075
Have them record the boy's statement and bring it to me.

00:19:24.235 --> 00:19:25.245
And one more thing...

00:19:33.485 --> 00:19:36.115
It is okay to cry. Why do you always hide everything?

00:19:37.615 --> 00:19:39.785
You think I cannot tell how upset you are?

00:19:41.455 --> 00:19:42.595
I do not have time to be sentimental.

00:19:43.195 --> 00:19:44.895
The son of the Jimjo's owner is right in front of me.

00:19:45.295 --> 00:19:46.295
My revenge is finally within reach.

00:19:47.365 --> 00:19:49.165
Letting myself get swayed by some pathetic emotion...

00:19:50.035 --> 00:19:51.035
That is just pathetic.

00:19:56.205 --> 00:19:57.205
Such a tough act.

00:19:58.105 --> 00:19:59.105
You are obviously hurt.

00:19:59.545 --> 00:20:01.375
Your eyes and the tip of your nose are bright red.

00:20:04.475 --> 00:20:05.515
So what if they are?

00:20:06.285 --> 00:20:08.015
So what if I am upset? What do you want me to do about it?

00:20:08.185 --> 00:20:09.855
I am not asking you to do anything.

00:20:17.295 --> 00:20:18.565
What do you think you are doing?

00:20:22.165 --> 00:20:23.265
Whenever I felt like this,

00:20:24.295 --> 00:20:26.105
I wished someone would just hold me.

00:20:27.035 --> 00:20:28.365
And since this is my body,

00:20:29.135 --> 00:20:30.975
I thought you might be feeling the same way.

00:20:35.815 --> 00:20:37.475
It is okay to lean on me.

00:20:38.275 --> 00:20:39.545
We are already sharing a body.

00:20:40.185 --> 00:20:42.755
It would be nice to share our hearts, do you not think?

00:21:04.675 --> 00:21:05.705
If you hold me this tightly,

00:21:11.745 --> 00:21:13.215
it feels like you are going to crush me.

00:21:51.615 --> 00:21:52.685
Do not forget.

00:21:53.785 --> 00:21:55.955
There is a line between you and me, even if it is invisible.

00:21:59.095 --> 00:22:00.095
Do not cross it.

00:22:07.965 --> 00:22:09.035
And if I do?

00:22:10.435 --> 00:22:11.945
What will you do then?

00:22:16.545 --> 00:22:17.615
You will live to regret it.

00:22:20.215 --> 00:22:21.415
And there will be no turning back.

00:22:27.855 --> 00:22:29.755
The boy from Qing will not talk.

00:22:30.155 --> 00:22:32.095
He seems to think we are all in on it together.

00:22:35.865 --> 00:22:37.695
Why is nothing ever easy?

00:22:38.705 --> 00:22:39.705
Let me get this straight.

00:22:40.235 --> 00:22:43.105
You let them brand you a traitor and just kept your mouth shut?

00:22:46.245 --> 00:22:48.475
Why did you go and make such a mess of it all?

00:22:48.875 --> 00:22:50.115
You have ended up with nothing to show for it.

00:22:50.515 --> 00:22:52.485
You should have either protected U Hui,

00:22:52.785 --> 00:22:54.344
or gone all out and taken down the Left State Councillor...

00:22:54.345 --> 00:22:55.785
to prove your loyalty!

00:22:56.385 --> 00:22:59.155
There cannot be two good guys.

00:23:01.125 --> 00:23:02.225
The good guy...

00:23:06.725 --> 00:23:08.695
Even if I am not the good guy,

00:23:10.795 --> 00:23:12.305
I do not have to be a complete jerk.

00:23:18.075 --> 00:23:19.705
Get my official robes ready now.

00:23:20.545 --> 00:23:21.545
Yes.

00:24:01.845 --> 00:24:03.115
What are you doing?

00:24:03.685 --> 00:24:04.885
You have to hide it.

00:24:05.585 --> 00:24:07.085
Bury it deep down.

00:24:07.785 --> 00:24:09.455
Why would you reveal your lingering feelings?

00:24:30.115 --> 00:24:31.415
Please send Dal out.

00:24:35.485 --> 00:24:36.585
Just speak.

00:24:38.385 --> 00:24:41.755
I have proof that the Left State Councillor still has the Jimjo.

00:24:42.495 --> 00:24:44.055
You do? What is it?

00:24:44.595 --> 00:24:46.165
Did you find out where the Jimjo is?

00:24:56.105 --> 00:24:59.775
I was the one pressuring him, but you seem more worked up, Dal.

00:25:04.375 --> 00:25:08.445
All right, go on. What is this proof?

00:25:10.155 --> 00:25:14.225
The boy from Qing believes I lied, so he will not speak easily.

00:25:14.425 --> 00:25:15.725
And even if he does,

00:25:16.325 --> 00:25:18.225
we cannot be sure he is telling the truth.

00:25:28.505 --> 00:25:29.675
In this book...

00:25:30.275 --> 00:25:33.575
is everything the boy told me about the Jimjo.

00:25:37.175 --> 00:25:38.175
But before I give it to you,

00:25:38.745 --> 00:25:40.245
you must make me a promise.

00:25:42.385 --> 00:25:44.155
Even if you take down the Left State Councillor,

00:25:47.125 --> 00:25:48.625
you must spare U Hui's life.

00:26:04.975 --> 00:26:06.005
Leave the book.

00:26:06.945 --> 00:26:08.974
I will consider it and let you know.

00:26:08.975 --> 00:26:10.975
I will only give it to you if you promise.

00:26:14.145 --> 00:26:15.685
Between me, who has already lost someone precious,

00:26:16.255 --> 00:26:19.155
and you, trying to protect someone, who do you think is more desperate?

00:26:21.285 --> 00:26:22.694
I will give you my answer about the Crown Princess Consort...

00:26:22.695 --> 00:26:24.095
after careful consideration.

00:26:24.925 --> 00:26:26.995
So leave the book and go.

00:26:32.565 --> 00:26:33.935
Hey, Prince Je Un.

00:26:36.875 --> 00:26:39.145
Why did you even write that book?

00:26:39.545 --> 00:26:41.445
What was the point if you were just going to betray us?

00:26:45.445 --> 00:26:46.645
I just wanted to...

00:26:49.115 --> 00:26:50.215
put it off.

00:26:51.285 --> 00:26:54.085
If I defeat the Left State Councillor, U Hui becomes a slave.

00:26:54.485 --> 00:26:56.855
But if I do nothing, Gang will be in danger.

00:26:59.895 --> 00:27:01.165
I did not know what to do.

00:27:03.995 --> 00:27:05.935
Then you should have just picked a side.

00:27:07.205 --> 00:27:08.805
Either you should have begged His Highness for forgiveness,

00:27:09.475 --> 00:27:12.035
or burned that book to stop this whole revenge plot.

00:27:12.105 --> 00:27:13.105
What is this pathetic indecisiveness?

00:27:14.675 --> 00:27:15.675
If I begged,

00:27:16.145 --> 00:27:18.345
would that erase the fact that I betrayed my brother?

00:27:22.985 --> 00:27:24.885
And if I burned the book,

00:27:25.385 --> 00:27:27.985
could I take back the horrible things I said to U Hui?

00:27:30.825 --> 00:27:32.425
I am always a coward.

00:27:33.995 --> 00:27:35.965
And a coward cannot make a choice.

00:27:40.365 --> 00:27:42.205
How utterly cowardly of me.

00:27:42.875 --> 00:27:45.235
Even though I know I am the reason for all this danger,

00:27:47.505 --> 00:27:49.115
and yet, all I have done is hurt her.

00:27:56.115 --> 00:27:57.315
I wonder if cowardice runs in the family.

00:28:03.655 --> 00:28:05.525
Why do I keep acting so pathetic?

00:28:23.575 --> 00:28:26.245
Gosh, this writing is minuscule.

00:28:27.545 --> 00:28:30.685
You can only write like this if you pour your heart into it.

00:28:31.555 --> 00:28:35.425
A betrayer would not be this careful. Absolutely not.

00:28:39.425 --> 00:28:40.865
Hey, now.

00:28:41.695 --> 00:28:42.695
The line.

00:28:45.095 --> 00:28:48.065
Fine. I get it. Okay.

00:28:48.465 --> 00:28:51.135
There. See? A line.

00:28:51.375 --> 00:28:53.345
I made a line. Happy now?

00:28:55.545 --> 00:28:58.415
- Do you not dare cross that line. - Unbelievable.

00:29:01.345 --> 00:29:04.385
So, did you find any new information in there?

00:29:07.925 --> 00:29:11.025
The Jimjo Poison becomes harmless within three days of extraction.

00:29:12.395 --> 00:29:13.395
The Left State Councillor gained power over Joseon...

00:29:13.396 --> 00:29:14.425
with the Jimjo Bird.

00:29:14.965 --> 00:29:16.865
He is not the kind of man who would throw away such a prize.

00:29:17.335 --> 00:29:20.035
He definitely still has the Jimjo.

00:29:23.205 --> 00:29:24.205
Actually,

00:29:24.905 --> 00:29:27.345
back when I was almost enslaved over the incident in your chambers,

00:29:28.175 --> 00:29:30.215
His Majesty said something to me.

00:29:30.645 --> 00:29:32.445
Do not defy the Left State Councillor.

00:29:34.315 --> 00:29:36.685
The Gyesa Year Incident is not over yet.

00:29:37.355 --> 00:29:38.955
Come to think of it,

00:29:41.425 --> 00:29:43.055
does that not mean the Jimjo is still alive?

00:29:45.225 --> 00:29:48.225
Then our objective has become clear.

00:29:49.965 --> 00:29:52.865
We have to find the Jimjo and expose its owner.

00:29:54.265 --> 00:29:55.265
Then what?

00:29:56.275 --> 00:29:57.874
We will prove the Gyesa Year Incident...

00:29:57.875 --> 00:29:59.245
was a murder by Jimjo Poison,

00:29:59.745 --> 00:30:03.945
and the owner is the real culprit behind it and a traitor.

00:30:04.745 --> 00:30:05.945
Even if he is the Left State Councillor,

00:30:06.845 --> 00:30:08.815
he will not be able to escape the charge of treason.

00:30:10.415 --> 00:30:11.415
Then,

00:30:12.115 --> 00:30:14.355
with the Gyesa Incident autopsies His Highness has gathered...

00:30:14.555 --> 00:30:17.855
and all those other documents,

00:30:18.525 --> 00:30:20.425
we just have to catch the Jimjo, right?

00:30:23.195 --> 00:30:24.995
We need more conclusive evidence.

00:30:30.075 --> 00:30:32.605
We must catch the Jimjo alive on the Left State Councillor's estate.

00:30:32.745 --> 00:30:36.115
We should search his private estate then.

00:30:53.895 --> 00:30:55.625
I did not think you would come, Ok.

00:30:56.065 --> 00:30:57.965
It has been a long time, Left State Councillor.

00:31:01.165 --> 00:31:03.935
Can you not speak casually to me like you used to?

00:31:17.285 --> 00:31:18.285
I suppose...

00:31:18.955 --> 00:31:21.355
I will never see the old you I once knew again.

00:31:21.755 --> 00:31:23.925
It is I who has lost the younger brother I once cherished.

00:31:28.225 --> 00:31:30.695
Why did you wish to see me today?

00:31:32.905 --> 00:31:33.965
Dal of the Park family.

00:31:35.065 --> 00:31:37.535
The girl from Boryeong who was a peddler.

00:31:37.805 --> 00:31:39.035
She is my wife's niece.

00:31:39.875 --> 00:31:41.505
How do you know of her, Your Excellency?

00:31:41.945 --> 00:31:42.945
Strange, is it not?

00:31:44.315 --> 00:31:47.145
As your wife's niece, you would think she is from a noble family.

00:31:47.715 --> 00:31:50.385
And yet, she was a peddler, then an eunuch,

00:31:50.685 --> 00:31:52.685
and now a court lady.

00:31:53.625 --> 00:31:55.825
A court lady in the Crown Prince's chambers, no less.

00:31:57.295 --> 00:31:58.625
In times like these,

00:31:59.165 --> 00:32:01.195
what could be more frightening than wagging tongues?

00:32:02.365 --> 00:32:06.005
I heard she lost her parents and took odd jobs to make ends meet.

00:32:06.835 --> 00:32:08.965
You are not that close, I take it?

00:32:11.275 --> 00:32:12.305
That used to be the case.

00:32:13.075 --> 00:32:15.575
But I do not know if you are aware, Your Excellency,

00:32:16.745 --> 00:32:19.285
but that girl, Dal, saved my daughter's life.

00:32:19.645 --> 00:32:22.785
I have come to treat her like my own daughter,

00:32:23.355 --> 00:32:26.485
and I have promised to protect her with my life.

00:32:26.785 --> 00:32:29.395
And here I thought she was so fearless and impertinent.

00:32:31.325 --> 00:32:33.265
Turns out she had someone in her corner.

00:32:36.565 --> 00:32:37.565
If I...

00:32:38.635 --> 00:32:40.435
were to harm that girl...

00:32:41.435 --> 00:32:42.435
Then I...

00:32:43.675 --> 00:32:45.335
will not stand idly by.

00:32:52.415 --> 00:32:53.415
No wonder.

00:32:54.615 --> 00:32:58.015
I was wondering why you agreed to meet me so easily.

00:32:59.385 --> 00:33:01.455
You came here today to warn me, did you not?

00:33:03.595 --> 00:33:04.595
In that case,

00:33:06.965 --> 00:33:08.265
since I have said my piece,

00:33:09.395 --> 00:33:10.595
I will take my leave now.

00:33:18.935 --> 00:33:19.975
Listen, Han Chul.

00:33:21.575 --> 00:33:22.715
Are you satisfied now?

00:33:23.775 --> 00:33:26.615
Be satisfied with what you have, and stop here.

00:33:28.715 --> 00:33:29.715
If you go any further,

00:33:30.585 --> 00:33:32.485
even the deepest revenge becomes meaningless.

00:34:20.165 --> 00:34:21.305
What revenge...

00:34:23.035 --> 00:34:24.335
ever brings satisfaction?

00:34:26.875 --> 00:34:29.005
(Dal's Quarters)

00:35:00.845 --> 00:35:01.905
Look, it is not like...

00:35:03.815 --> 00:35:07.185
- I am not taking his side, but... - Gosh.

00:35:07.745 --> 00:35:09.085
Sounds like you are already not on my side.

00:35:10.685 --> 00:35:13.425
If I am being honest,

00:35:14.425 --> 00:35:16.395
you are not even guaranteeing the Crown Princess Consort's safety,

00:35:16.895 --> 00:35:19.325
but you just keep taking all the information.

00:35:19.595 --> 00:35:21.465
That is kind of a betrayal, is it not?

00:35:29.105 --> 00:35:30.935
I have stopped at nothing to get this far.

00:35:32.375 --> 00:35:34.245
You think a guilty conscience will hold me back?

00:35:35.245 --> 00:35:36.575
I do not care if they call me a coward.

00:35:38.515 --> 00:35:39.815
And I do not care if they call me dirty.

00:35:50.995 --> 00:35:53.225
So what if you are a coward?

00:35:53.995 --> 00:35:55.965
Who cares if you have to play a little dirty?

00:35:58.335 --> 00:36:00.135
The bad guys do terrible things like it is nothing,

00:36:00.465 --> 00:36:02.505
and all fate ever does is dump on us,

00:36:02.835 --> 00:36:04.135
so how can anyone not stoop to their level?

00:36:04.575 --> 00:36:06.145
How can you not feel beaten down?

00:36:09.175 --> 00:36:10.315
So, it is okay.

00:36:10.715 --> 00:36:12.445
Even if you have to be a coward or stoop low,

00:36:12.785 --> 00:36:14.145
just lie low for a little while.

00:36:14.485 --> 00:36:16.755
Even if the whole world turns on you,

00:36:17.215 --> 00:36:18.355
the one taking all the heat right now...

00:36:20.025 --> 00:36:21.025
is me.

00:36:33.435 --> 00:36:35.705
There she goes again, mercilessly breaking down my walls.

00:36:37.605 --> 00:36:40.175
What? What was that?

00:36:40.475 --> 00:36:41.475
The line.

00:36:43.375 --> 00:36:45.615
Gosh. Sure.

00:36:46.215 --> 00:36:50.215
What is next? You want me to just wait outside?

00:36:50.455 --> 00:36:51.515
Get away.

00:36:53.085 --> 00:36:54.155
As far as you can.

00:37:05.565 --> 00:37:07.135
Come on, Mangdeok. Time for dinner.

00:37:08.765 --> 00:37:12.475
Are you not the cutest?

00:37:14.705 --> 00:37:18.045
Gosh. A dog's life is the best life.

00:37:18.115 --> 00:37:21.145
You eat meat that most commoners can only dream of. Right?

00:37:21.215 --> 00:37:23.415
You seem to have a lot of complaints about the country.

00:37:23.555 --> 00:37:27.255
No, I am just jealous, that is all.

00:37:27.455 --> 00:37:31.355
He just hangs out in this big palace and have someone feed him.

00:37:31.855 --> 00:37:33.895
Is that not a better life than what most people have?

00:37:35.525 --> 00:37:36.695
Gosh.

00:37:36.765 --> 00:37:40.235
If only someone would bring me my meals regularly...

00:37:47.645 --> 00:37:48.645
"A dog's life"?

00:37:49.075 --> 00:37:50.874
Are you saying I have a dog's life?

00:37:50.875 --> 00:37:51.945
No.

00:37:53.615 --> 00:37:56.045
Not you. I was talking about the Jimjo. The Jimjo Bird.

00:37:56.385 --> 00:37:57.614
The Left State Councillor owns it, right?

00:37:57.615 --> 00:38:00.355
He would not just let it roam free.

00:38:00.785 --> 00:38:03.055
So if it is caged up, how does it get fed?

00:38:03.155 --> 00:38:06.055
Nice try changing the subject. Why ask something so obvious?

00:38:10.735 --> 00:38:11.735
(The Left State Councillor's man bought a Jimjo...)

00:38:11.795 --> 00:38:12.805
(and started a fire at the owner's house.)

00:38:12.865 --> 00:38:13.905
(He was wearing a mask.)

00:38:16.905 --> 00:38:18.805
The Jimjo's keeper?

00:38:23.875 --> 00:38:24.875
(Cheonghye Merchant Guild)

00:38:26.075 --> 00:38:28.615
These from the Cheonghye Guild are precious and restorative,

00:38:29.585 --> 00:38:30.755
so I will store them separately myself.

00:38:38.855 --> 00:38:42.395
(Honey supplied by Cheonghye Merchant Guild)

00:39:00.445 --> 00:39:01.485
Your Royal Highness.

00:39:02.345 --> 00:39:05.455
It is a great honour to have you grace my humble home.

00:39:06.255 --> 00:39:07.785
Where does one obtain poisonous insects?

00:39:08.325 --> 00:39:10.825
Common folks cannot catch them. Only specialised hunters can.

00:39:13.995 --> 00:39:15.665
Then we must first meet the hunters in the capital city.

00:39:15.825 --> 00:39:18.094
What? Are you just going to walk up and ask them,

00:39:18.095 --> 00:39:19.635
"Hey, do you feed the Jimjo?"

00:39:19.865 --> 00:39:21.105
Or ask if they know the man in the mask?

00:39:21.405 --> 00:39:22.405
Then...

00:39:23.135 --> 00:39:24.135
what do we do?

00:39:25.175 --> 00:39:26.175
I just so happen...

00:39:27.445 --> 00:39:30.275
to have an expert catcher, a swallow, up my sleeve.

00:39:31.315 --> 00:39:32.945
Right. Yes.

00:39:33.485 --> 00:39:34.915
But how do you know who I am?

00:39:35.145 --> 00:39:36.384
He looks familiar.

00:39:36.385 --> 00:39:38.685
You saw him at the Royal Office of Attire, Your Highness.

00:39:38.955 --> 00:39:39.955
He can identify Jimjo Poison.

00:39:41.225 --> 00:39:43.855
Where on earth would you find a poison like that?

00:39:44.155 --> 00:39:45.825
Unless you are talking about Jimjo Poison.

00:39:47.465 --> 00:39:50.765
Right. The acupuncture physician? I remember now.

00:39:51.665 --> 00:39:55.565
Lady, you claimed to have found him. How can you only remember now?

00:39:57.735 --> 00:39:59.135
Right, so...

00:39:59.335 --> 00:40:03.175
His Royal Highness just remembered, not me.

00:40:03.345 --> 00:40:05.445
Oh, it is all coming back to me now.

00:40:09.015 --> 00:40:11.115
But I thought we came to see the snake catchers.

00:40:11.285 --> 00:40:15.055
Physicians and snake catchers have always been close.

00:40:15.255 --> 00:40:17.455
Now, this gentleman... No,

00:40:17.825 --> 00:40:22.225
This person will be a big help. You will get valuable information.

00:40:29.465 --> 00:40:31.335
- What? - Lady.

00:40:31.935 --> 00:40:32.945
Come on, let us do this!

00:40:34.675 --> 00:40:35.675
Why me?

00:40:37.815 --> 00:40:39.015
No way!

00:40:41.745 --> 00:40:45.515
If we are seen with snake catchers, the Left State Councillor will know.

00:40:45.715 --> 00:40:48.785
You are under less scrutiny, so you are perfect for the job.

00:40:52.295 --> 00:40:54.425
Come on, wait for me!

00:40:55.665 --> 00:40:57.694
- Do you know him? - Do you?

00:40:57.695 --> 00:40:59.335
I do not know. I have no idea!

00:40:59.465 --> 00:41:00.635
We do not know him.

00:41:03.775 --> 00:41:04.775
Again?

00:41:06.675 --> 00:41:07.675
Go on.

00:41:16.855 --> 00:41:18.385
Look here. Do you know what this is?

00:41:19.955 --> 00:41:21.225
This is another dead end...

00:41:21.285 --> 00:41:23.155
Take a closer look. A really good look.

00:41:23.625 --> 00:41:24.925
Here. You do not recognise him?

00:41:25.825 --> 00:41:27.395
I do not know. I really do not.

00:41:56.395 --> 00:41:58.025
Fine, just go.

00:41:58.425 --> 00:41:59.765
Go on, fly away.

00:42:01.295 --> 00:42:02.895
Nobody recognises him anyway.

00:42:04.795 --> 00:42:05.795
Go away!

00:42:06.805 --> 00:42:07.805
Go!

00:42:58.085 --> 00:42:59.715
Please give me one more chance.

00:43:01.855 --> 00:43:03.555
I found it in Park Dal's quarters.

00:43:04.395 --> 00:43:06.195
I thought it might be a love letter...

00:43:14.505 --> 00:43:16.235
So, it is a love letter to Grand Prince Un.

00:43:18.935 --> 00:43:21.205
But there is no mention of Grand Prince Un.

00:43:21.445 --> 00:43:23.045
The apple does not fall far from the tree.

00:43:23.575 --> 00:43:26.115
Both you and your niece.

00:43:26.515 --> 00:43:28.485
Court ladies in love.

00:43:31.255 --> 00:43:32.255
I will do it.

00:43:33.355 --> 00:43:34.755
I will do anything.

00:43:36.355 --> 00:43:38.255
Please just spare Mi Geum.

00:43:39.825 --> 00:43:41.925
I will make sure that girl take the infertility drug this time.

00:43:42.195 --> 00:43:43.235
Get rid of her.

00:43:45.365 --> 00:43:46.835
You said you just had something to confirm...

00:43:47.735 --> 00:43:49.605
and that I only had to give her the infertility drug.

00:43:49.805 --> 00:43:52.435
A past memory made me soft for a moment,

00:43:53.975 --> 00:43:55.605
but if you let the past hold you back,

00:43:56.515 --> 00:43:58.345
you can never move forward.

00:43:59.415 --> 00:44:02.215
That face that looks too much like the Deposed Crown Princess.

00:44:04.855 --> 00:44:05.855
It unnerves me.

00:44:09.225 --> 00:44:12.155
How can two families be wiped out on the same day?

00:44:12.355 --> 00:44:16.325
Their old mother who cannot speak. How will she survive on her own?

00:44:16.395 --> 00:44:17.465
Tell me about it.

00:44:26.575 --> 00:44:29.375
Judging by the lack of reaction from the silver needle,

00:44:29.805 --> 00:44:31.075
I do not believe it is poison.

00:44:31.275 --> 00:44:34.145
If it was not poison, then how could two families die at the same time?

00:44:34.415 --> 00:44:38.885
With poison, the body is usually bloated or black from decay...

00:44:38.915 --> 00:44:39.955
No reaction to silver.

00:44:40.785 --> 00:44:42.585
And the body is not turning black or decaying.

00:44:42.885 --> 00:44:43.895
It is Jimjo Poison.

00:44:44.655 --> 00:44:45.825
In this case, the investigation should...

00:44:46.055 --> 00:44:48.264
No break-in or poison was found.

00:44:48.265 --> 00:44:50.065
Should we not rule it as death by unknown causes?

00:44:50.565 --> 00:44:51.565
Death by unknown causes?

00:44:51.635 --> 00:44:53.205
I need to write the report. Move the bodies to the Bureau.

00:44:53.265 --> 00:44:54.265
Darn it.

00:44:54.535 --> 00:44:55.535
Yes, sir.

00:45:10.285 --> 00:45:11.285
Excuse me.

00:45:14.755 --> 00:45:15.755
By any chance,

00:45:16.955 --> 00:45:18.225
have you seen this man?

00:45:26.095 --> 00:45:27.805
I am not here to harm you.

00:45:28.505 --> 00:45:29.635
I am here to help you.

00:45:33.675 --> 00:45:34.675
This man...

00:45:36.545 --> 00:45:38.115
is the one who killed your family, is he not?

00:45:43.315 --> 00:45:45.855
I am looking for him too. His leader...

00:45:48.055 --> 00:45:49.485
killed my family too.

00:45:51.125 --> 00:45:52.325
So, please, will you tell me...

00:45:52.925 --> 00:45:54.625
everything you know about him,

00:45:56.065 --> 00:45:58.565
so I can catch him and get my revenge...

00:46:00.305 --> 00:46:01.835
and get justice for you?

00:46:32.195 --> 00:46:33.265
This scent pouch...

00:46:34.605 --> 00:46:35.665
is his?

00:46:54.085 --> 00:46:56.625
What was that? His Majesty is looking for me?

00:46:58.925 --> 00:47:00.525
There is no getting out of it today.

00:47:07.635 --> 00:47:10.605
- What did the desk ever do to you? - What was that?

00:47:11.005 --> 00:47:12.005
Pardon?

00:47:13.005 --> 00:47:15.375
It is nothing.

00:47:16.075 --> 00:47:19.115
So, why did you summon me?

00:47:20.015 --> 00:47:23.085
The Chief Court Lady kidnapped Park Dal,

00:47:23.415 --> 00:47:25.555
and you still have not learned your lesson?

00:47:26.725 --> 00:47:27.725
I am sorry?

00:47:28.885 --> 00:47:33.295
- Kidnapped? - That girl was prepared to die...

00:47:33.525 --> 00:47:37.765
fighting the infertility drug. Have you no shame, Crown Prince?

00:47:39.495 --> 00:47:42.805
But over here, it seems there is drug on it.

00:47:43.335 --> 00:47:44.335
No, wait.

00:47:44.975 --> 00:47:45.975
Then that time...

00:47:47.845 --> 00:47:50.775
Do not tell me you did not know.

00:47:51.745 --> 00:47:52.745
No.

00:47:53.985 --> 00:47:55.085
I had no idea.

00:47:58.855 --> 00:47:59.855
I...

00:48:02.085 --> 00:48:03.525
I knew absolutely nothing.

00:48:17.075 --> 00:48:19.705
- Spare some change for an offering. - Not interested.

00:48:19.775 --> 00:48:23.545
You seem to have bad karma. If no offering, how about a beating?

00:48:24.075 --> 00:48:25.075
What are you talking about?

00:48:27.985 --> 00:48:28.985
What?

00:48:30.015 --> 00:48:32.015
Hey! What are you two doing here?

00:48:32.615 --> 00:48:34.825
You little brat! What are you doing here?

00:48:35.725 --> 00:48:37.995
- Stay still, will you? - What's this?

00:48:38.955 --> 00:48:42.125
- Why is this coming off? - Duck your head. This is flimsy.

00:48:42.195 --> 00:48:44.895
Let us talk somewhere private. All three of us are fugitives here.

00:48:44.965 --> 00:48:45.965
Right. This way.

00:48:46.035 --> 00:48:49.065
Wait. Hey, hold on. Where are you taking me?

00:48:49.335 --> 00:48:52.405
- What is going on? - Dal! You are not hurt, are you?

00:48:52.675 --> 00:48:53.675
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:48:54.045 --> 00:48:57.015
Physically, I am fine, but...

00:48:57.545 --> 00:48:58.545
Give it back.

00:49:00.145 --> 00:49:04.285
You did not happen to meet anyone or remember anything, did you?

00:49:04.715 --> 00:49:07.285
I met a bunch of people,

00:49:07.785 --> 00:49:09.885
but nothing in particular comes to mind.

00:49:10.795 --> 00:49:11.795
Why?

00:49:13.255 --> 00:49:14.265
Good enough.

00:49:17.265 --> 00:49:18.265
Tie her up.

00:49:18.635 --> 00:49:20.035
- Right. - Tie me up? What for?

00:49:20.805 --> 00:49:23.735
Why? Why are you tying me up? What is this? Let go!

00:49:23.875 --> 00:49:25.335
Untie me this instant!

00:49:26.135 --> 00:49:27.605
I have to go to the Palace!

00:49:27.645 --> 00:49:30.375
You are not going to the palace but to the skies.

00:49:30.675 --> 00:49:33.315
The skies? That is ridiculous! What are you talking about?

00:49:34.245 --> 00:49:35.885
I am asking you nicely. Now, untie me!

00:49:36.015 --> 00:49:38.855
- Dal, want to take a little nap? - Sleep? Are you kidding me?

00:49:39.355 --> 00:49:42.225
How much of this should I give her?

00:49:47.025 --> 00:49:51.065
Should I give her the whole thing?

00:49:51.695 --> 00:49:55.035
- No. A corpse cannot get on a boat. - I see.

00:49:55.735 --> 00:49:57.235
A corpse?

00:49:59.635 --> 00:50:01.805
Send word to the palace!

00:50:02.545 --> 00:50:04.075
Summon His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince!

00:50:05.945 --> 00:50:07.685
Dal, how do you know His Royal Highness?

00:50:08.785 --> 00:50:13.525
- You really met His Royal Highness? - I did. I mean, yes.

00:50:14.785 --> 00:50:16.385
His Royal Highness the Crown Prince is my backer,

00:50:16.855 --> 00:50:18.425
so there is no need for me to escape to the skies.

00:50:21.665 --> 00:50:22.665
The scar.

00:50:24.695 --> 00:50:26.135
When did it disappear?

00:50:27.705 --> 00:50:28.705
What was that?

00:50:35.475 --> 00:50:39.145
- Hey, do not touch it. - I did not. Gosh.

00:50:39.815 --> 00:50:41.385
- What? - What?

00:50:42.015 --> 00:50:45.585
And who might this be? I missed you all so much.

00:50:46.485 --> 00:50:47.725
- Your Royal Highness! - Your Royal Highness!

00:50:47.985 --> 00:50:50.895
My goodness, what are you doing?

00:50:51.195 --> 00:50:53.055
Get up. Come on.

00:50:53.625 --> 00:50:56.895
It is me. Mom, Dad, it is your daughter, Dal.

00:50:57.065 --> 00:51:00.065
What? No, you are not Dal,

00:51:00.405 --> 00:51:02.705
and you are not our daughter.

00:51:03.065 --> 00:51:05.005
- He is a man. - Right.

00:51:06.505 --> 00:51:08.075
So here is what happened.

00:51:14.685 --> 00:51:15.785
You!

00:51:16.845 --> 00:51:17.855
Wait a minute.

00:51:19.455 --> 00:51:20.455
You?

00:51:21.025 --> 00:51:22.025
So, let me get this straight.

00:51:22.925 --> 00:51:26.325
The Crown Prince grabbed the scar on Dal's wrist,

00:51:26.395 --> 00:51:28.625
there was a flash of light, you fell into the water,

00:51:28.995 --> 00:51:29.995
and you two swapped bodies?

00:51:30.435 --> 00:51:32.265
What is this, some kind of folktale?

00:51:32.595 --> 00:51:34.935
What is next? You will say you hatched from an egg?

00:51:35.265 --> 00:51:37.005
Of course.

00:51:37.335 --> 00:51:39.734
I am surprised a dragon did not appear,

00:51:39.735 --> 00:51:40.975
and I did not sprout wings.

00:51:41.075 --> 00:51:42.075
Goodness.

00:51:42.805 --> 00:51:44.515
That smart mouth definitely belongs to our daughter.

00:51:44.745 --> 00:51:47.545
No, a person can pick up someone else's way of talking.

00:51:47.645 --> 00:51:49.185
Pick it up? What is it, the plague?

00:51:51.755 --> 00:51:52.755
But now that I look closely,

00:51:53.455 --> 00:51:55.955
that subtle glimmer in his eyes...

00:51:56.425 --> 00:51:58.755
is our daughter's eyes.

00:52:00.225 --> 00:52:04.565
Have you lost your mind? Your Royal Highness, please kill me!

00:52:04.965 --> 00:52:06.165
We are deeply sorry, Your Royal Highness.

00:52:07.605 --> 00:52:09.765
That is the mark of a sealed red thread of fate.

00:52:10.205 --> 00:52:12.005
If the read thread of fate, which was forcibly severed,

00:52:12.475 --> 00:52:15.645
should stir upon finding its true partner again,

00:52:16.105 --> 00:52:18.375
then even I will be powerless to stop it.

00:52:20.385 --> 00:52:22.185
I have committed a grave offence.

00:52:26.885 --> 00:52:27.985
Everyone, leave us.

00:52:28.925 --> 00:52:31.995
Your Royal Highness, please stay and speak with me.

00:52:38.095 --> 00:52:39.095
Close it.

00:52:40.195 --> 00:52:43.165
- Your Highness! - Your Highness! No, we just...

00:52:45.205 --> 00:52:47.045
Come now, this way.

00:52:47.845 --> 00:52:48.845
Your Royal Highness.

00:52:52.015 --> 00:52:53.045
Now, speak.

00:52:53.345 --> 00:52:55.345
There is more to Dal's scar, is there not?

00:52:55.815 --> 00:52:56.815
A long time ago,

00:52:58.085 --> 00:53:00.015
Dal once fell into the water.

00:53:00.825 --> 00:53:03.425
A red scar suddenly appeared on her wrist then.

00:53:04.155 --> 00:53:05.495
After that, she lost her memory,

00:53:06.455 --> 00:53:08.395
and I have thought it peculiar ever since.

00:53:09.395 --> 00:53:10.395
The water?

00:53:11.065 --> 00:53:12.795
There is definitely something about the water, then.

00:53:14.335 --> 00:53:15.335
What else?

00:53:15.865 --> 00:53:19.335
Was there anything else unusual? Tell me everything you know.

00:53:19.835 --> 00:53:21.875
You want us to switch back, do you not?

00:53:26.175 --> 00:53:27.215
All I know...

00:53:28.115 --> 00:53:29.285
is everything I have told you.

00:53:44.295 --> 00:53:46.995
My mom and dad may have run away,

00:53:47.865 --> 00:53:49.805
but they are by no means bad people.

00:53:50.305 --> 00:53:51.635
You know that old saying, right?

00:53:51.975 --> 00:53:53.905
"Falling in love is not a crime."

00:53:54.605 --> 00:53:57.145
There is that load of nonsense, anyway.

00:53:59.545 --> 00:54:01.215
Some love can be a crime.

00:54:01.645 --> 00:54:03.045
It is a sin, but still...

00:54:03.615 --> 00:54:05.215
I saved your life, and...

00:54:05.455 --> 00:54:07.084
The fact that our bodies even switched...

00:54:07.085 --> 00:54:08.655
This cannot be some ordinary fate.

00:54:10.225 --> 00:54:11.895
So for my sake, could you...

00:54:12.095 --> 00:54:14.265
Are you worried I will harm your family?

00:54:15.165 --> 00:54:19.735
- You locked them in Unjeong Palace. - Locked them?

00:54:20.865 --> 00:54:21.865
I am protecting them.

00:54:23.135 --> 00:54:25.135
The Left State Councillor knows about your family's inn,

00:54:25.605 --> 00:54:28.505
I worried he might take them hostage to threaten you.

00:54:29.775 --> 00:54:33.375
I had no idea. Gosh, I was worried for nothing.

00:54:34.745 --> 00:54:37.585
But why the long face?

00:54:39.115 --> 00:54:40.785
The snake hunters and their families...

00:54:41.255 --> 00:54:42.525
were killed with the Jimjo Poison.

00:54:43.285 --> 00:54:44.555
It is so cruel.

00:54:45.095 --> 00:54:46.525
How are those left behind supposed to go on?

00:54:50.165 --> 00:54:51.165
It is all my fault.

00:54:51.965 --> 00:54:55.435
If I had not gone poking around, they would still be alive.

00:54:55.765 --> 00:54:57.405
How is that your fault, Your Royal Highness?

00:54:58.075 --> 00:54:59.505
Someone else did the killing.

00:55:01.075 --> 00:55:04.115
I hate how I always let things slip through my fingers.

00:55:06.875 --> 00:55:08.415
Even those I am sworn to protect,

00:55:09.815 --> 00:55:12.815
I could not protect a single one of them.

00:55:15.055 --> 00:55:16.385
You protected me.

00:55:28.235 --> 00:55:29.564
The Chief Court Lady almost forced me...

00:55:29.565 --> 00:55:30.775
to drink that infertility potion,

00:55:31.305 --> 00:55:32.675
but you protected me, Your Royal Highness.

00:55:33.675 --> 00:55:35.244
I could have been dragged and killed,

00:55:35.245 --> 00:55:36.675
but you fought to the very end...

00:55:37.745 --> 00:55:39.175
and protected me.

00:55:41.315 --> 00:55:42.715
How did you find out about that?

00:55:44.385 --> 00:55:45.585
I had hoped you would never find out.

00:55:46.855 --> 00:55:48.855
The Queen Dowager told me everything.

00:55:49.855 --> 00:55:54.525
You should have let me drink it. Why did you fight them over it?

00:55:54.795 --> 00:55:57.165
What if something happened to you? How could I possibly go on?

00:55:59.195 --> 00:56:00.665
What do you think that was? Some sweet drink?

00:56:01.605 --> 00:56:03.635
If you drank that, what about your dreams?

00:56:04.375 --> 00:56:05.635
Wearing flower shoes and settling down...

00:56:05.935 --> 00:56:06.975
with your own family...

00:56:07.545 --> 00:56:08.675
What would happen to all of that?

00:56:12.415 --> 00:56:13.415
You fought...

00:56:15.845 --> 00:56:19.185
- just for that? - How can that be just anything?

00:56:20.215 --> 00:56:21.225
They are your dreams.

00:56:24.725 --> 00:56:26.225
Why are you doing this to me?

00:56:28.295 --> 00:56:29.495
I was just going to live my life...

00:56:30.595 --> 00:56:33.295
with my hair turning white, and my memories fading to black,

00:56:33.865 --> 00:56:35.735
living like a cold winter's night.

00:56:38.835 --> 00:56:41.375
You just had to shower me with flower petals.

00:56:45.075 --> 00:56:46.615
Why did you shower me with flower petals?

00:56:48.285 --> 00:56:49.985
Because you keep doing this, Your Highness...

00:56:50.215 --> 00:56:51.485
Because you keep doing this...

00:56:55.385 --> 00:56:58.155
You make my heart weak.

00:56:59.355 --> 00:57:03.425
The feelings I tried hard to swallow now feel so painful and unfair.

00:57:03.665 --> 00:57:04.995
And so I want to be comforted.

00:57:06.095 --> 00:57:07.935
And I want it to be you, Your Royal Highness.

00:57:12.875 --> 00:57:15.145
You are making me hope for the impossible!

00:57:18.115 --> 00:57:19.145
Hope for what?

00:57:21.245 --> 00:57:22.745
Do you like me, Your Royal Highness?

00:57:54.685 --> 00:57:55.715
Your Royal Highness.

00:58:05.025 --> 00:58:08.095
Forgive my impertinence, but I am here to arrest Park Dal.

00:58:10.665 --> 00:58:11.665
Wait a minute.

00:58:13.335 --> 00:58:16.305
Wait, on what charge are you arresting her?

00:58:17.835 --> 00:58:19.075
Regardless of the grounds,

00:58:19.335 --> 00:58:22.275
you dare arrest a court lady before the Crown Prince?

00:58:22.945 --> 00:58:25.075
Is that how you show contempt for your superior?

00:58:25.415 --> 00:58:28.715
How could I dare commit such an act of disloyalty?

00:58:29.215 --> 00:58:32.115
I am merely carrying out His Majesty's order.

00:58:32.855 --> 00:58:33.885
An order from His Majesty?

00:58:36.525 --> 00:58:38.154
Grand Prince Je Un had an affair...

00:58:38.155 --> 00:58:39.525
with the court lady from the Crown Prince's chambers?

00:58:39.895 --> 00:58:43.165
We found evidence in her quarters, Your Majesty.

00:58:43.625 --> 00:58:47.535
- What evidence? - Does the evidence matter?

00:58:48.205 --> 00:58:50.975
What matters is not what the evidence is,

00:58:51.275 --> 00:58:53.805
but how we are to punish them.

00:58:55.845 --> 00:58:57.875
You have already made up your mind, have you not?

00:58:58.575 --> 00:59:04.285
My only wish is for the safety of Your Majesty and the Crown Prince

00:59:05.915 --> 00:59:07.085
An illicit affair?

00:59:07.855 --> 00:59:10.325
What is this absurd frame-up?

00:59:11.125 --> 00:59:12.754
Is it not true you stayed at the Grand Prince Je Un's home...

00:59:12.755 --> 00:59:14.195
before entering the palace?

00:59:14.425 --> 00:59:18.865
A witness also saw you at his home late at night recently.

00:59:18.995 --> 00:59:20.094
That was because I was running an errand...

00:59:20.095 --> 00:59:21.205
- for the Crown Prince. - You wench!

00:59:21.605 --> 00:59:23.705
How dare you bring the Crown Prince into this?

00:59:26.235 --> 00:59:27.335
Then I suppose this...

00:59:28.545 --> 00:59:30.875
was also written by His Royal Highness?

00:59:35.115 --> 00:59:38.285
You recognise it. Your love letter to Grand Prince Je Un.

00:59:39.615 --> 00:59:40.785
Grand Prince Je Un...

00:59:42.225 --> 00:59:43.485
Are you kidding me?

00:59:44.595 --> 00:59:47.295
Does this look like a love letter to Grand Prince Je Un?

00:59:49.495 --> 00:59:53.665
- You think this only affects me? - Do not worry.

00:59:54.505 --> 00:59:56.465
The Grand Prince is under interrogation as we speak.

01:00:04.075 --> 01:00:05.215
Goodness.

01:00:05.875 --> 01:00:08.715
Left State Councillor, do you have a crush on me?

01:00:09.385 --> 01:00:10.955
Why are you so obsessed with me?

01:00:11.915 --> 01:00:15.985
Indeed. I cannot look away from you. Grand Prince Je Un.

01:00:19.295 --> 01:00:23.995
People become so predictable the moment they get power.

01:00:24.735 --> 01:00:28.035
Toward the Royal Mother and toward me as well.

01:00:39.475 --> 01:00:40.475
Come on.

01:00:41.145 --> 01:00:42.845
There is a limit to how far you can push this.

01:00:43.315 --> 01:00:44.915
You call this a love letter?

01:00:45.385 --> 01:00:48.185
And on top of that, you claim it is for the Grand Prince?

01:00:48.585 --> 01:00:50.355
This is completely absurd.

01:00:50.895 --> 01:00:53.924
In the letter, they name themselves.

01:00:53.925 --> 01:00:55.865
Grand Prince Je Un and Dal of the Park family.

01:00:56.665 --> 01:00:58.065
What? What are they?

01:00:58.895 --> 01:01:02.605
"The night is dark, the moon bright. Why is my heart as hazy as a cloud?"

01:01:02.665 --> 01:01:04.475
You are telling me this one line is proof of an affair?

01:01:05.735 --> 01:01:07.975
So if you cannot find any real dirt on them,

01:01:08.045 --> 01:01:09.505
you will just invent some to tear them down?

01:01:11.375 --> 01:01:12.745
A report was filed,

01:01:13.315 --> 01:01:16.115
and a love letter was discovered in Park Dal's quarters.

01:01:16.845 --> 01:01:18.285
This is a matter concerning the court ladies,

01:01:19.155 --> 01:01:23.325
so it is only right to handle it according to their code of conduct.

01:01:25.725 --> 01:01:28.025
Fine. Leave the letter and go.

01:01:30.165 --> 01:01:32.465
- But, Your Highness... - Why the hesitation?

01:01:33.435 --> 01:01:35.705
Are you afraid I might dispose of the letter?

01:01:43.545 --> 01:01:46.215
I will just say that I wrote the letter.

01:01:46.615 --> 01:01:47.945
It is in your handwriting, after all.

01:01:48.245 --> 01:01:50.045
If you claim you wrote that letter,

01:01:50.215 --> 01:01:53.515
the Queen Dowager's faction will use it to make you a concubine.

01:01:53.685 --> 01:01:54.985
And if you were to refuse,

01:01:55.525 --> 01:01:56.525
she would charge you with the crime...

01:01:56.526 --> 01:01:57.924
of refusing the Crown Prince's favour...

01:01:57.925 --> 01:02:00.255
and threaten to have you beheaded.

01:02:01.625 --> 01:02:04.495
Seriously? Beheaded over a scrap of paper?

01:02:06.135 --> 01:02:07.495
That is the way of the palace.

01:02:09.665 --> 01:02:11.435
A place where life and death hang on a single piece of paper.

01:02:13.335 --> 01:02:14.475
A ruthless place.

01:02:18.175 --> 01:02:19.275
So,

01:02:20.475 --> 01:02:21.745
do not do anything.

01:02:22.115 --> 01:02:24.915
Neither I nor Grand Prince Je Un will ever admit to it.

01:02:25.815 --> 01:02:29.685
If we both deny it to the very end, what can they possibly do?

01:02:30.525 --> 01:02:34.925
They tried to take and sterilize me. You expect me to let that go?

01:02:35.095 --> 01:02:37.565
I have to do something.

01:02:37.635 --> 01:02:41.065
If I am forced to marry and take a concubine I do not love,

01:02:41.535 --> 01:02:42.535
what about how I feel?

01:02:59.715 --> 01:03:02.025
I will be on my way.

01:03:03.255 --> 01:03:04.855
Please promise me something.

01:03:05.955 --> 01:03:09.195
Your Royal Highness, you cannot protect Dal.

01:03:10.695 --> 01:03:13.335
When you return to your own body, without any hesitation,

01:03:14.605 --> 01:03:17.435
and without any lingering regrets, let Dal go.

01:03:28.715 --> 01:03:31.315
My feelings for you cannot be allowed to hold you down.

01:03:34.785 --> 01:03:36.325
I must hide them deep inside.

01:03:38.855 --> 01:03:40.755
Without leaving a single trace.

01:03:43.165 --> 01:03:44.695
So that not even my shadow gives me away.

01:03:52.705 --> 01:03:54.545
This must be why our bodies switched.

01:03:55.805 --> 01:03:57.245
So I would get hurt instead of you.

01:03:59.275 --> 01:04:01.345
So I would experience all this humiliation myself.

01:04:01.985 --> 01:04:04.285
I am never to escape the guilt I feel toward the Crown Princess.

01:04:16.225 --> 01:04:17.364
You think this was just a reminder...

01:04:17.365 --> 01:04:18.495
of your guilt about the late Crown Princess?

01:04:23.305 --> 01:04:27.375
I know you are the Crown Prince and think the world is all about you.

01:04:27.845 --> 01:04:30.675
But I am the main character of my own life, you know.

01:04:31.005 --> 01:04:34.585
Do not use someone's life as a prop for your drama, Your Highness!

01:04:35.415 --> 01:04:36.945
What is with this sudden outburst?

01:04:37.015 --> 01:04:38.915
You want to know why I protect you, Your Highness?

01:04:39.315 --> 01:04:41.725
It is because protecting you is how I protect my own body.

01:04:42.225 --> 01:04:43.725
I could not take care of my own body,

01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:45.225
and you could not care for others.

01:04:45.325 --> 01:04:48.495
So the skies gave us this punishment to learn from each other. Got it?

01:05:06.275 --> 01:05:07.544
- Se Dol. - Yes?

01:05:07.545 --> 01:05:09.614
Do you know where the diaries or love letters I wrote...

01:05:09.615 --> 01:05:10.885
to the late Crown Princess are?

01:05:11.045 --> 01:05:14.315
If that is what you are looking for, they should be over here.

01:05:14.585 --> 01:05:15.825
- What? - This way.

01:05:21.695 --> 01:05:23.025
Right under my nose.

01:05:24.225 --> 01:05:26.365
Is this some kind of safe?

01:05:26.495 --> 01:05:29.965
Why are you asking me? You put it there, Your Highness.

01:05:41.915 --> 01:05:44.285
What? What is that?

01:05:52.525 --> 01:05:53.525
What?

01:05:56.265 --> 01:05:58.735
- No... - Is this not mine now?

01:05:59.165 --> 01:06:01.135
So I will do whatever I want with it.

01:06:05.105 --> 01:06:06.735
Wait, why is this here?

01:06:06.935 --> 01:06:11.005
You are the one who picked it up. Why ask me, Your Royal Highness?

01:06:17.915 --> 01:06:20.985
Here is the diary you wrote to the late Crown Princess.

01:06:21.355 --> 01:06:23.525
But why are you suddenly looking for this?

01:06:24.085 --> 01:06:25.925
That love letter they claim is proof of Dal's affair,

01:06:26.455 --> 01:06:27.555
I wrote it.

01:06:30.125 --> 01:06:32.765
Why so surprised? I probably wrote it to the Crown Princess,

01:06:35.105 --> 01:06:36.505
not Dal.

01:06:39.375 --> 01:06:40.535
If I show them this,

01:06:41.445 --> 01:06:43.275
I should be able to clear Dal's name.

01:06:43.575 --> 01:06:45.875
If you say you wrote that love letter, Your Royal Highness,

01:06:46.615 --> 01:06:49.045
do you think the Queen Dowager will buy it?

01:06:49.345 --> 01:06:53.685
She will find a way to twist this and make Dal a royal concubine.

01:06:54.485 --> 01:06:56.355
We have to put out the most urgent fire first.

01:08:01.625 --> 01:08:02.885
Sleep eludes me.

01:08:04.255 --> 01:08:06.725
I thought it was my bedding that was uncomfortable,

01:08:07.655 --> 01:08:08.825
but it must be my heart.

01:08:10.025 --> 01:08:12.135
The night is dark, and the moon is bright,

01:08:12.965 --> 01:08:17.865
so why, as if shrouded in clouds, is my heart so bleak?

01:08:21.705 --> 01:08:23.105
I am not myself,

01:08:24.105 --> 01:08:25.475
and you are not yourself.

01:08:27.715 --> 01:08:31.045
And in the empty space, a dull longing stretches, settles.

01:08:32.855 --> 01:08:34.655
Will finding what I have lost be enough?

01:08:35.785 --> 01:08:37.485
Will returning to my rightful place be enough?

01:08:39.795 --> 01:08:40.995
Only then...

01:08:42.965 --> 01:08:44.025
will I finally find peace?

01:08:50.565 --> 01:08:51.975
Maybe this feeling...

01:08:54.875 --> 01:08:56.275
is not for the Crown Princess...

01:08:58.045 --> 01:08:59.145
but for me.

01:09:05.915 --> 01:09:07.455
What is the meaning of this?

01:09:08.155 --> 01:09:12.025
How could Prince Un's love letter be found in Park Dal's quarters?

01:09:12.855 --> 01:09:15.595
Do you think I spared her life for this?

01:09:16.825 --> 01:09:19.735
For the sin of daring to insult and betray me,

01:09:20.835 --> 01:09:24.505
- I will make her pay dearly for it! - I wrote that letter.

01:09:26.775 --> 01:09:32.075
You are saying you wrote a love letter to that girl?

01:09:32.675 --> 01:09:33.715
Pardon me?

01:09:35.745 --> 01:09:39.485
It was not a love letter. It was just a poem.

01:09:40.585 --> 01:09:44.995
So, though you fancied her enough to write her a poem,

01:09:45.155 --> 01:09:47.425
she rejected your royal favour?

01:09:48.495 --> 01:09:49.564
She would charge you with the crime...

01:09:49.565 --> 01:09:50.595
of refusing the Crown Prince's favour...

01:09:50.795 --> 01:09:53.035
and threaten to have you beheaded.

01:09:54.595 --> 01:09:56.565
Answer me, Crown Prince!

01:09:56.935 --> 01:09:58.775
Dal never refused.

01:10:00.735 --> 01:10:01.745
In that case,

01:10:02.045 --> 01:10:06.575
are you planning to take Park Dal as your Royal Concubine?

01:10:11.045 --> 01:10:12.055
Yes.

01:10:12.715 --> 01:10:16.385
I will take Dal as my Royal Concubine.

01:10:18.325 --> 01:10:19.825
Court Lady Yoon!

01:10:20.855 --> 01:10:21.895
Yes, Your Highness!

01:10:23.395 --> 01:10:25.895
Have Park Dal released at once.

01:10:26.335 --> 01:10:28.605
I am issuing a decree to make her a Royal Concubine.

01:10:30.165 --> 01:10:31.205
About that...

01:10:33.235 --> 01:10:37.105
The Chief Court Lady ordered Park Dal to be flogged.

01:10:38.005 --> 01:10:39.175
Flogged, you say?

01:10:39.675 --> 01:10:40.945
Right now...

01:11:22.025 --> 01:11:24.385
- Your Highness! - Stop this at once!

01:12:05.435 --> 01:12:07.135
Your Royal Highness!

01:12:08.165 --> 01:12:10.435
Your Royal Highness.

01:12:11.105 --> 01:12:12.105
Your Royal Highness.

01:12:12.905 --> 01:12:14.305
Please pull yourself together.

01:12:15.245 --> 01:12:16.245
Your Royal Highness...

01:12:31.385 --> 01:12:32.395
My body...

01:12:34.495 --> 01:12:35.965
I am back in my own body.

01:12:36.465 --> 01:12:37.465
Yes.

01:12:39.295 --> 01:12:40.435
We are back.

01:12:42.405 --> 01:12:43.405
We are back.

01:12:47.735 --> 01:12:48.745
Dal!

01:12:49.545 --> 01:12:51.505
Dal!

01:12:53.275 --> 01:12:54.275
Dal!

01:13:15.735 --> 01:13:17.005
Please kill me.

01:13:20.805 --> 01:13:21.845
Gladly.

01:13:25.775 --> 01:13:27.775
I will kill every last one of you!

01:13:30.585 --> 01:13:35.725
(Moon River)

01:13:50.765 --> 01:13:54.335
From now on, I will be your shield. You just hide behind me.

01:13:54.405 --> 01:13:56.304
Do not give your heart to the Crown Prince.

01:13:56.305 --> 01:13:59.115
To survive and be loved, win his.

01:13:59.175 --> 01:14:01.845
Are you telling me to kill the Crown Prince?

01:14:01.885 --> 01:14:03.915
There is a distillery at the foot of Mount Inwang.

01:14:04.015 --> 01:14:08.285
Why would you burden your soft heart with yet another weakness?

01:14:08.355 --> 01:14:10.085
- Goodness! - Dal!

01:14:19.795 --> 01:14:21.835
Since you came rushing here so frantically,

01:14:22.105 --> 01:14:24.465
it left me no choice but to banish Grand Prince Je Un.

01:14:36.885 --> 01:14:40.855
They say the art of bonsai is in the pruning.

01:14:42.955 --> 01:14:46.595
To keep it from growing twisted or wild,

01:14:47.225 --> 01:14:50.225
it must allow its branches to be cut to conform and survive.

01:14:53.695 --> 01:14:55.765
You always told me, Father,

01:14:56.535 --> 01:14:59.705
that I should be the flower blooming at the highest peak in Joseon.

01:15:07.175 --> 01:15:08.545
I am here to yield.

01:15:08.915 --> 01:15:12.715
As you have always wished, Father, I will live like that flower.

01:15:17.325 --> 01:15:18.995
So, please spare Grand Prince Je Un's life.

01:15:54.225 --> 01:15:58.365
