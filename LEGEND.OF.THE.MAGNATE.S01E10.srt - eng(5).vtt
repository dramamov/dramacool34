[Legend of the Magnate]

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.950
[Episode 10]

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.750
Enough with your honeyed words.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.039
I'm leading troops to battle imminently

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.200
and have no patience
for long-winded speeches.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.060
Speak plainly!

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.979
Your Highness,

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.110
do you realize

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.039
how many carts are needed

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.900
to transport 24 million taels of silver?

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.430
It would require
over a hundred large carts

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.000
and over a hundred strong men
to manage them.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.920
The route would also pass

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.470
through numerous prefectures and counties.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.710
May Your Highness please clarify

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.770
what should be written
on the banners.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.590
What banners?

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.030
When transporting

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.430
such a vast sum of silver by cart,

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.190
the banners

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.160
must clearly state their purpose.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.630
Is it
for Your Highness's military provisions

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.960
or for the sustenance
of your royal household?

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.750
We Eight Families of Hedong

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.810
have deliberated.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.950
Even if we must
melt our cauldrons for scrap

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.870
and risk our lives,

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.150
we will raise this sum.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.910
Your Highness licks blood
from the blade's edge,

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.630
risking your life for the nation.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.120
Should we

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.320
quibble over silver,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.910
we'd be ungrateful wretches.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.630
You should have said so earlier

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.630
and spared yourselves this ordeal.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.060
Write out an IOU for Li Baiwan

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.140
and summon him.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.630
That old fellow really knows
how to get things done.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.690
No, Your Highness,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.550
that won't do!

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.720
We were just discussing—

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.870
we can provide the funds,

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:53.710
but we cannot

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.520
let Li Baiwan

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.490
reap the credit.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.150
Silver looks the same

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.000
everywhere.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.750
Is

00:02:59.079 --> 00:02:59.870
Li Baiwan's silver

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.130
any shinier than ours?

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.630
Your Highness, imagine

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.630
if you campaigned through great hardship

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.470
only to see another take the glory—

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.820
could you stomach that?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.680
Moreover,

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.590
the Eight Families of Hedong

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.280
are influential clans
with centuries of history.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.280
From the provincial capital
to the imperial court,

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.230
each of them

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.800
has allies among the imperial censors
and ministers.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.520
If Your Highness oppresses us
too harshly,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.579
this goodwill may turn to grievance.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.360
Truth be told, we intend

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.079
to give more than 24 million taels—

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.910
considerably more.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.840
Whatever Li Wantang paid

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.470
to enlist your pressure,

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.910
we will match.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.120
Such a sharp tongue!

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.880
I am

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.400
a prince leading armies—

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.680
do you take me for a merchant?

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.000
We beg Your Highness
to leave us a path to survival.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.460
Then state your proposal.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.170
As you command.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.840
Since Your Highness

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.280
campaigns along the Yellow River,

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.740
let this sum be designated

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.450
as military provisions

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.680
from the Eight Families of Hedong.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.010
But the amount

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.570
is staggering—

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.120
once the silver carts roll out,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.590
it will cause an uproar.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.120
We need not fear memorials

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.000
from censors,

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.520
for Your Highness' merits overshadow all.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.440
What we dread is

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.440
others reaching out

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.630
to claim a share,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.370
spoiling the endeavor.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.480
Thus, I propose

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.030
transporting the silver to the capital

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.410
to exchange for banknotes
from the Four Major Banks—

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.870
portable and convenient.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.070
Your Highness could then

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.240
simply tuck them into your robe.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.640
Wouldn't that be better?

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.950
Good.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.800
Then produce the banknotes.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.390
How long?

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.980
Two months to load the silver,

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.130
reach the capital,

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:41.740
convert to banknotes,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.980
and deliver to you—

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.530
this already requires traveling
day and night.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.050
Your Highness,

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.140
behold:

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.560
the signed pledge
of the Eight Families of Hedong

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.760
with personal seals.

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:58.240
[Donation of 24 million taels
by the Eight Families of Hedong]

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.520
"Donation of 24 million taels

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.160
[To Prince Shen,
redeemable against this document.]

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.020
to Prince Shen,

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.300
redeemable against this document."

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.600
Once you receive the banknotes,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.480
simply return this slip.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.610
How can I trust

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.360
this flimsy paper

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.990
to be worth 24 million?

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.190
You expect me

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.080
to release you based on this?

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.040
Do you take me for a child?

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.100
Your Highness,

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.000
do not underestimate

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.070
this thin slip.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.960
Could Li Baiwan produce such a pledge?

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.950
The Eight Families of Hedong

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.360
have thrived over 300 years—

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.880
in both capital and credibility,

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.159
we are, perhaps,

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.950
a slight step above Li Baiwan.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.240
Unless Your Highness intends

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.040
to destroy us,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.680
in which case I shall say no more

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.070
and await execution.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.800
You wouldn't dare flee.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.770
If I don't see those banknotes
in two months,

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.360
my troops

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.190
will raze your ratholes. Now go!

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.260
Get out now!

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.610
As you command.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.920
Pack up the supplies.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.480
We break camp for Shandong.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.390
A new imperial decree every single day!

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.390
This is trying the patience
of even someone like me.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.310
At once.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.600
Young Master,

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.560
the manager of Taiyufeng, Mr. Gu,
is here to see you.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.600
Tell him I'm not in.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.240
Wait—

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.980
why refuse him?

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.800
He'll think I'm scheming against him.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.650
Scheming?

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.240
He's with Taiyufeng,

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.310
and you're with Wanyuandang.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.040
If you're not scheming against him,
then who?

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.570
Go ahead.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.560
Ask him

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.480
when he plans to hand over

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.280
those 3 million taels of silver.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.110
And how did he even get released?

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.010
How could the boy

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.170
be so soft-hearted?

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.750
The Young Master is still young.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.800
He finally made a friend

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.820
here in Shanxi.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.950
A friend?

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.720
Do we need to come all the way
to Shanxi to make friends?

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.600
We're here to take

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.750
over these draft banks—

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:11.680
this is a battlefield!

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.310
There's no room for sentimentality.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.390
You're right, you're right.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.650
I'll talk to him again.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.510
How was that man released?

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.770
Why wasn't I informed?

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.190
I was concerned, Master,
that you would be angered

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.830
and planned to tell you later.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.070
That lad convinced the eight families

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.870
to sign a pledge to His Highness,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.160
guaranteeing they'd deliver

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.560
24 million taels in Four Major Banks

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.600
within 2 months.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.240
His Highness was in a hurry
to march to Shandong,

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.370
so he agreed.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.050
Unacceptable!

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.800
I'll speak to His Highness.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.800
His Highness has already departed.

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:43.260
Fool!

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.070
With silver shining
right before their eyes,

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.800
he smugly walked away with a mere IOU

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.000
instead of crushing the Eight Families

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.070
while he had the chance.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.240
If he ever collects that debt,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.500
I'll take his surname!

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.630
Whose idea was this?

After what your father has done—

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:16.800
offending every draft bank in Shanxi

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.120
from top to bottom—

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.130
how could he possibly stay?

Such a promising situation,

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.970
utterly ruined.

What a perfectly staged scene—

and in the end, it's that kid
who walks away with all the credit.

Your father relies solely on brute force.

But in business,

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.150
integrity is the foundation,
righteousness the root,

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:20.480

You stay.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:44.920
Your task is simple:

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.190
spread the word

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.320
that each of these eight families

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:50.670
owes the court 3 million taels in silver—

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.470
clearly documented in writing.

once sealed, it becomes state property.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.000
Trigger a bank run
among their depositors,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.550
and crush them one by one.

to squeeze out all their reserves.

and I also want King Li's treasure.

How could you do

Rely on diligence alone,

and you might never gain a foothold.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.720
To kill a snake,
you must strike its vital spot.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.390
Crush their hopes,

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.360
and seize their essence.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.000

stay by the Master's side
for a couple of years—

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:42.120

could ever rival you?

Do not continue to rely

on power to bully others.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.080
or did you conceive it yourself?

Back in the penal colony,

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.120
when no one

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.480
had much silver on hand,

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.960
we often traded

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:31.750
this way.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.510
Say I needed to hunt a tiger—

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.600
I'd require spears, blades,

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.630
tools, and provisions.

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.930
I could only pledge repayment

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.200
on the condition
that I successfully brought

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.150
the tiger back.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.790
The shopkeeper would then make

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.950
the same

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.030

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:51.360
to the blacksmith.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.120
Over time,

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:54.390
this method of transaction

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:55.520
gained acceptance.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.150
That tiger might

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.680
still be roaming the mountains,

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.230
but among us,

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.250

and sold many times over.

Wang Tiangui is only detaining me

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:21.640
to escape his grasp.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.770
He's a man with no lineage to preserve—

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:29.030
vicious at heart
and ruthless in his actions.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:29.890
You can't trust

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.230

This battle hasn't even started yet.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.400

for the Eight Families;

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.270

Everyone has seen

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.590
your skill and capability;

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:47.120
even a man like Wang Tiangui

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.100
has to treat you with respect.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.350
This is the perfect time
for you to make your exit.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.750
Don't throw that away
out of stubbornness.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:56.710
Mr. Chang,

00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:59.030

and secure your freedom this time,

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.350
I will never forgive myself.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.070
A true man, in navigating life
and society,

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.790
must be clear about friendship and enmity.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:09.640
I will always remember

I may not speak of it often,

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:14.240
but that doesn't mean I'm unaware.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:17.480
Now,

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.350
I should return to the bank—

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:22.480
Wang Tiangui is likely looking for me.

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:23.310
In the next couple of days,

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.000
I'll make a trip to Jinyang Villa.

have just regained their footing,

It's time to visit them.

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:31.960
Okay.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:21.660
Leave me be.

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:23.310
Cry if you want to.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:26.150
How can I leave you be?

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:27.690
Are you a ghost?

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.420
I'm worse off than a ghost.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.140
At least a ghost may be reborn—

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:36.110
there's hope.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:38.370
What hope do I have?

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:48.510
It's late.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.200
Enough tears.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.240
Come,

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:57.240
let me walk you back.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.510
You weren't eavesdropping
on my talk with Father, were you?

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:10.960
No.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.400
What did you discuss?

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:13.550
Nothing much.

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:15.810
He did praise you, though.

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.050
If Mr. Chang doesn't blame me
for dragging him into this,

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:20.310
that's blessing enough.

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:21.910
I dare not expect his praise.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.100
Stop saying

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.960
you're neither human nor ghost,

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.890
as though life isn't worth living.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:31.880
If you truly felt that way,

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:33.400
why did you escape

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.640
from Ningguta at all?

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:37.280
You will live on, and live well.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.960
You

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:39.160
and my father,

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.450
both of you are good people.

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:44.510
I often wonder,

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:47.210
if you hadn't gone to Ningguta,

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.030
if I hadn't stirred up so much trouble,

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:50.590
maybe your life

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:51.850
would've been easier.

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:54.480
Gu,

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:58.350
I've come to a realization.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:31:59.850
Will you hear it?

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:01.160
I will.

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:04.170
I sincerely

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.960
do not regret going to Ningguta.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.490
I do not regret meeting you.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.720
And I sincerely hope

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:11.950
that you and my father will soon be free—

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:13.330
that all who've harmed you

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:14.110
will be gone,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
that you'll

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:18.270
return home, see your family,

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.220
honor your betrothal,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.730
and live out your days in peace.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:25.830
As for myself,

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.350
I too will live a good life.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.510
Even if I wander the world

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:30.640
with my father,

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:33.590
having known you in this life—

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:35.850
that is enough.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:40.830
To aid the desperate
and rescue the imperiled

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:41.400
in their hour of greatest need—

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.130
that is the code of the Jianghu.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:49.150
Let us both be at peace with that.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.150
I'm home.

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:42.360
See?

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:45.630
Even you can be
left speechless sometimes.

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:48.400
Gu,

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.280
is your heart at ease now?

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.090
Where the heart rests,
there lies my home.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.330
So sentimental.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.110
[Fenglingdu Inn]

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:14.840
Is Mr. Li from the capital

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.100
staying here tonight?

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:18.560
What is it?

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:20.630
I've been riding for two days—

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:22.960
I've come all the way
from Pingyao with a message.

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.620
It seems that lad surnamed Gu

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.730
is resorting to such a petty trick.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.630
I fear your Taiping Bank may not

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:30.560
hold its ground in Shanxi anymore.

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:33.490
So close, yet so far.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.630
Back when His Highness caught them

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:37.520
at Jinyang Villa, I said,

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:38.720
"Don't let them go."

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:41.860
But he thought holding their IOU

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.560
meant no one

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:44.920
would dare renege.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:48.480
I know

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.070
you deposited funds in all eight families

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:52.730
precisely for a run like this.

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.190
At the time, I didn't fully grasp it.

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.590
Now I see:

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.320
"To take, you must first give."

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:00.630
Truly shrewd.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.510
Just withdraw the money

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:05.470
and see if they can withstand it.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.230
"Dead silver stays,

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.700
and living silver returns home."

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.850
Do you understand what that means?

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:18.630
It means the silver

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:19.760
that's just sitting there stays,

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.490
and the rest comes back, right?

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.010
Half a year before you arrived,

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:26.550
we deposited over 6 million
taels of silver

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:27.710
with the Eight Families

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:29.070
through other firms.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.190
The plan was

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:32.750
to suddenly strike during a run,

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:33.920
demanding the full withdrawal

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:34.920
all at once

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:36.630
to force them to shut down.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.550
That move

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.030
was set long ago.

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:44.090
But judging by the letter,

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:47.070
it seems we're not making that move—

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:49.340
we're just leaving the money there.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.340
How can that be?

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.590
That's handing them

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:55.150
a huge advantage for nothing.

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:56.710
Then go ahead

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:57.850
with the plan!

00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:59.590
Since we're leaving anyway,

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.360
there's no reason
to suffer such a crushing defeat.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.400
I'll write to the Master at once.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.280
What for?

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:04.440
We've already followed
your advice this far,

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.770
and look where it got us.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.030
Stop it!

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.320
I have an idea—

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.800
we could still fight back.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:18.930
Want to give it a try?

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:21.720
Young Master,

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:23.810
please don't act recklessly.

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:27.440
Oh, so only you're allowed to be reckless?

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:34.550
Today,

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:36.360
the kitchen is fully stocked,

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.400
and they'll be serving around the clock.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.330
Eat, drink, and enjoy yourselves!

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:44.960
Mr. Sun,

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:47.520
I suppose our dishes

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.120
still can't compare

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:51.010
to those few bowls of spoiled rice

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.440
you enjoyed the other day, can they?

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.860
Don't mention that spoiled rice!

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:08.030
Madam,

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:09.400
could we please not

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:09.670
bring that up again?

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:10.760
Just hearing about it

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:11.590
makes my throat itch

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:13.720
as if a little hand were scratching it.

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:15.280
Madam.

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:19.480
Come on.

00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:29.670
Mr. Gu,

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:30.980
take a look at this.

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:36.630
What is it?

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:38.400
[A withdrawal of six million taels
is scheduled for prior to noon tomorrow.]

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.000
That Li Baiwan

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:41.480
deposited 6 million taels of silver

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.340
in our draft banks half a year ago.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.890
Now he wants
to withdraw it all at once.

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:50.800
If we eight families

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.920
have to scrape together

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.070
6 million taels right now,

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:54.710
our liquidity will be completely drained.

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:55.710
This isn't silver—

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:57.570
it's a blade aimed at our throats.

00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.150
Even with Mr. Gu's plan

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:00.840
to unite the eight families,

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:01.760
which of us could

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.220
withstand a run like this?

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:06.480
The depth of Li Baiwan's scheming

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.060
is truly chilling.

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:12.440
Do you

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000
intend to pay him?

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:19.140
What do you suggest?

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.130
We'll follow your lead.

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:23.000
In my opinion,

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:24.400
this is Li Baiwan's

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.460
final hidden card.

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:27.360
But simply handing it over like this

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.080
would be

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:29.150
most unwise.

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:31.150
Since he wants it,

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:33.040
then we shall give it to him.

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:34.480
I'm familiar with Wang Tiangui's accounts

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:35.230
and I can

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.760
produce 2 million taels of silver

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.840
at once.

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.420
What about the rest of you?

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:51.630
I'll contribute

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.110
four million.

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:54.560
The full amount?

00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.850
Excellent.

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:00.360
I'll sweep

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:01.480
our vaults clean

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.030
and contribute everything as well.

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:04.160
Is that acceptable?

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:09.430
What kind of deal is this?

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.400
M-Me too! Count me in!

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:13.940
What a vicious idea.

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:14.960
I'll go get paper and brush.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.290
Let's settle the score.

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:20.890
Just what is this deal?

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.000
Tell me, what's going on?

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:25.960
Don't keep me in suspense!

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.190
Mr. Gu has a proposal:

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:30.510
Taiping Bank is offering an interest rate
of 30% on deposits—

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:32.360
a full ten percentage points
higher than ours.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.230
If Li Baiwan

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:34.760
wants to move his funds,

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.280
fine.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:36.840
Let's give him

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.760
every tael we have.

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:42.630
We'll turn his own money
against him and live off the interest!

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:44.210
What a splendid plan!

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:45.750
In the back and forth,

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:46.710
this is such a big deal.

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:47.280
Indeed.

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:57.790
[Taiping Bank]

00:40:58.760 --> 00:40:59.630
My dear Young Master,

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:00.880
how can you still sleep
at a time like this?

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.630
They are already

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:02.800
on our doorstep!

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:04.400
Who is on our doorstep?

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:12.740
[Taiping Bank]

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.690
This...

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:16.800
Open the doors.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.840
Can't you see? They're all here

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:18.900
to deposit silver.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:19.760
They're returning

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.760
the 6 million taels of silver?

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:21.660
More than that!

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.630
Look—the silver carts

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:23.760
are lined up stretching

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:24.800
over 10 miles beyond Pingyao!

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.030
Our interest is 10% higher—

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.920
they've brought silver

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:27.840
to earn the interest from us.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:28.760
The Eight Families

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.890
are nearly drained.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.480
I told you to listen to the Master,

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:35.590
but you just had to be stubborn about it.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:36.030
Well?

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:38.040
Now, do you even dare open the door?

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.600
Young Master,

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:42.800
you're actually opening it?

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.110
What's the point of fighting me on this?

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:45.510
We must have a clear plan!

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:48.960
Can't you even cover this amount?

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.760
I thought you said we were prepared!

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:51.400
Young Master,

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.550
even if we had mountains
of gold and silver,

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:54.110
we can't be taken for such fools!

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:55.280
We're about to shutter this place
and return to the capital.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.150
Why offend the Eight Families

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:57.550
and pay them interest on top of it?

00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:58.510
What's the point?

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:00.110
We'll be the laughingstock.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.450
Stop knocking!

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.660
Everyone inside is dead and gone!

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:05.400
Dead and gone?

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.410
Alright then, dead and gone. Let's go.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.940
If we don't open the doors now,

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:13.030
we'll truly have

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:14.130
no place left here.

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.490
Have you decided what to do?

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.700
I'll follow your lead.

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:30.470
Now you decide to follow my lead?

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.230
Fine. Open them.

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:42.000
Mr. Li Qin.

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.800
Mr. Gu.

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.060
Where are those silver carts?

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:50.170
Come on out!

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.480
Just a joke.

00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:58.740
In the world of business,

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.240
goodwill is everything.

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:01.730
Who would

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:02.880
truly drive someone to ruin? Right?
