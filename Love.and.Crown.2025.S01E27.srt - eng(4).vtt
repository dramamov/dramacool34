Since you've already seen everything,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.610
then allow me

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.410
to send His Majesty off on his final journey.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.100
Do it.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.820
Ling Jueding, Governor of Jiangzhou,

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.980
is here by order to safeguard His Majesty!

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.060
The traitors have been eradicated.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.540
Ling Xuefeng,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.570
time to come to your senses.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.820
Jueding…

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.290
So your business in Xijiang was just a ruse,

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.220
and you slipped back into the Capital

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.260
all so you could strike your own father down!

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.850
Father!

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.660
You don't have to do this.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.010
I...

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.060
I don't need your lecture!

Xiao Huan…

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.340
You truly are the finest student I've ever taught.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.340
Today, I am

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.730
defeated fair and square.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.050
You ordered Lu Qi to use Ying to assassinate His Majesty.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.460
When that failed,

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.660
you tried one last desperate gamble.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.780
At the Imperial Assembly,

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.410
you meant to seize the throne.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.780
Ling Xuefeng,

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.580
how dare you!

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.790
The saying is true.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.100
Victors are kings, losers are nothing.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.660
You want to saddle me with every crime, old and new.

General Lu.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.780
Should I answer

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.100
for these crimes?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.730
Ling Xuefeng!

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.490
You ordered me

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.780
to use Princess Ying

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.730
to strike at His Majesty and commit treason.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.020
You dragged me down with you.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.980

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.580
you've lost in the end.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.490
Considering Father's old age

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.540
and the guidance he once gave him,

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.540
His Majesty has granted Father leave to cultivate peace at Fayun Temple

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.140
to pray for the Empress's well-being,

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.580
and to repent your sins.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:39.850
Father...

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.130
At this point,

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.530

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:12.650
For you, I'd gladly give my life.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.220
No regret.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:23.460
No resentment.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.180

Spring is still bitter and cold.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.420
Your Majesty should be recovering in the palace.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.530
Why would you come to see a condemned sinner?

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.340
I can't make sense of it.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.250
I truly can't.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:02.980
Why, Father...

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.980
Why did you still choose this path?

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.980
His Majesty already allowed you to retire in peace.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.130
So why?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.420
I, Ling Xuefeng,

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:22.010
spent decades pouring my life into Great Qi, rising through the court,

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.130
clawing my way forward.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.980
Everything I did was for Great Qi.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:29.820
It was either forward or fall behind.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.980
If I couldn't take a step ahead,

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:34.970
I'd face the same fate

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.740

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.420
You shouldn't have fought for

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.340
what was never yours.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.170
To you, this is ambition.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:00.270
To me,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.130
it's what my whole life has been.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:06.190
And now,

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.100
what angers me most is

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.770
that I was one move away from winning.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.060
But I have no regrets.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.300
Jueding has already asked His Majesty

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.650

away from the Capital,

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.180
to the cold northern frontiers,

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.130
to guard the borders for Great Qi and never return.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:43.770
Father.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.980
I've failed you.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:54.460
From now on...

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.180
I can't come to see you again.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:19.940
was dragging you into all this.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:23.540
Back then,

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.260
when you didn't want to marry Xiao Huan,

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:30.220
when you wanted to flee the marriage,

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.550
I'd wanted to let you go.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:39.980
Now...

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.780
If you still wish to leave,

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.710
go with Jueding.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.730
Leave the Capital behind.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:15.570
All I wish for you

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.290
is peace and happiness.

one brother

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:27.860
should at least fulfill our shared dream of roaming free.

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:29.860
Isn't that right?

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:32.190
You intend to walk away

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:33.830
with Xiao Ying just like that?

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.860
After what was done to her,

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:39.490
don't you want to know the truth?

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:43.050
Wasn't the one who hurt her

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.740
Ling Xuefeng?

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:48.450
It's never

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:49.820
that simple.

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:51.740
Ling Xuefeng was attacked.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.900
Someone wanted to silence him.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.090
And that someone

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:57.050
is very likely tied

00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:58.570
to Xiao Ying's attempt to assassinate me.

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:02.380
Think it over one more time.

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.970
Eunuch Feng, I'll trouble you with this, then.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:10.180
I hope His Majesty

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:11.530
takes care of himself.

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.490
We bid you farewell.

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:27.970
You were a gift from Li Hongqing.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.970
So you must bloom soon.

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:36.410
Ying.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:38.780
You remembered?

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:40.970
Remembered what?

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.180
Li Hongqing.

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:48.410
Her Majesty told me.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.450
She told me so many things about Li Hongqing.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.090
It made me happy,

00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:58.620
but somehow,

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:00.610
I feel this sadness

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:04.050
in my heart.

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:08.380
You intend

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:09.860
to walk away with Xiao Ying?

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:12.970
After what was done to her,

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:15.380
don't you want to know the truth?

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:19.340
Qianqing,

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.490
who is Li Hongqing?

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.780
Why do I feel such a longing to see him?

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.570
Can you take me to him?

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:35.260
All right.

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:37.340
I will take you to him.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:39.970
But you must behave,

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.740
all right?

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.180
This is the Soul-Severing Grass.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.220
It grows inside volcanic craters.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.900
Its fiery nature is extremely potent.

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:09.900
Its heat can force

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.380
venomous insects out through the skin and flesh.

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:18.490
Perhaps this Soul-Severing Grass

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.970
can drive out the Dual-Pupil parasite inside Princess Ying

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.220
and restore her clarity.

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:24.300
Let me do it.

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:25.530
Tell me how.

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.970
Your Highness mustn't.

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:29.410
Once the Soul-Severing Flame touches your skin,

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:31.340
it'll scorch the flesh in an instant.

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:33.820
Ordinary people can't control it.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.180
But...

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:37.860
His Majesty is an exception.

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:42.610
My body runs colder than most.

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.340
So this is a task

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.180
only I can undertake.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.410
The Soul-Severing Flame

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:49.530
must drive the medicinal heat

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:51.300
into the princess's meridians

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.220
for the duration of one joss stick each day.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.740
After three days,

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:56.260
the parasite will leave her body.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.820
However...

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.380
His Majesty will deplete a great deal of inner force.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.610
He may even suffer burns.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.180
It's fine.

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.930
Ying.

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:50.970
Ying.

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:52.410
Ying!

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.610
Ying!

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.570
Ying!

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:10.220
Qianqing...

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:11.050
Your Majesty.

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:11.780
Stop.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:12.610
This is enough.

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:13.740
Let's stop here.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.220
The parasite is reacting.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.180
That means the method is working.

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:19.130
Qianqing...

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.820
Ying!

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:22.260
Ying!

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:23.780
It hurts…

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.530
All I see is her pain.

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.410
It's sharp and searing,

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:33.780
a torment she can barely endure.

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:35.020
Don't worry.

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:37.280
I won't put her in danger.

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:39.900
However...

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.780
Ying is the only one who knows the clues.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.570
You want to walk away halfway.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.090
But I need to

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:47.970
know the truth.

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:51.660
Is the truth you're after

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.820
worth the pain Ying goes through?

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:57.490
She's not your sister.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:00.700
Of course you can harden your heart and look away.

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:02.740
But I can't.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.490
Ying, come with me.

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:07.530
We're leaving.

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:16.340
Move.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.180
You think you're the only one who sees her as family,

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:20.410
the only one who cares for her?

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:23.090
No one in this world

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.050
but Xiao Huan

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.300
truly knows what her pain feels like.

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:32.380
He grew up enduring pain no ordinary man could bear,

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.090
all for that gleam of hope after the storm.

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.780
Ying has held on for so long,

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:42.180
and now you want her to give up halfway?

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:43.900
What about everything she endured?

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:46.300
I won't let her suffer another moment.

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:48.410
I'll care for her all my life.

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:49.260
Xiao Qianqing!

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:51.660
Wake up.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.180
Ying doesn't remember anything now.

00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:58.180
She doesn't remember me.

00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:01.450
She doesn't remember us.

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:05.970
She doesn't remember anything.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.180
She doesn't remember Li Hongqing.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:10.530
Do you really think

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.740
she could ever be happy for the rest of her life?
