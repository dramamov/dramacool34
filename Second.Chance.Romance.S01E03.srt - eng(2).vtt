[Episode 3]

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.700
Madam.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.740
Yan, have a seat.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.940
What brings you

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.580
here today?

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.780
You love coffee, right?

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.180
I had someone

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.340
specially bring this back for you.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.340
Give it a try

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.100
and see if you like it.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.340
This must be really good.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.820
I can't go a day without it.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.420
Thanks.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.780
So, how are things with you two?

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.100
I guess

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.500
we're together now.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.180
What do you mean, "guess"?

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.300
We are together.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.540
Are you serious?

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.100
Yes, I am.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.780
How did you convince him?

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.420
I didn't really say much.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.900
I just said,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.860
maybe we should give it a shot.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.780
And he said, okay.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.180
When did this happen?

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.580
Just yesterday.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.300
Le will be

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.500
staying with me lately.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.220
You two should...

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.460
spend more time alone together.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.860
Madam...

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.780
I should get going.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.100
Madam, you...

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.700
Great.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.060
That's great.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:14.660
I'll head out.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.780
Madam, you...

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.900
Why didn't you tell me
about such a big thing?

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.900
What thing?

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.620
You're still keeping it from me.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.540
Yan told me everything.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.980
You agreed to be with her?

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.500
Yeah.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.940
That's wonderful.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.860
Wonderful.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.340
Let's hurry and set a date.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.580
Mom,

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.220
don't you think that's a bit too fast?

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.540
Too fast? I think it's long overdue.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.180
Listen, if you're too busy,

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.980
I can help with some
of the arrangements.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.980
Don't bother.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.740
We can handle it ourselves.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.620
Okay.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.740
Hurry up, you two.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.540
Alright.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.260
Great.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.420
Four, two, three, four.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.220
Arm positions.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.980
Five, six, seven.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.260
Good.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.620
Take a break.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.220
You're all in a much better state

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.500
than before.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.220
I'm really happy.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.140
When you get home, review

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.580
all the moves we learned today.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.140
Next class, we'll start
on new moves.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.940
That's all for today.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.500
- Thank you, Madam.
- Thank you, Madam.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.780
- Bye, Madam.
- Bye, Madam.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.660
You like ballet too?

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.620
You're my dad's friend.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.500
We met at the pastry shop.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.220
You have such a good memory.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.220
Ma'am, hello.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.460
Hello.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.860
I'm Feng Lexuan.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.380
So formal.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:18.740
I'm Tan Siting.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.420
You're a ballet dancer?

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.940
That's impressive.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.860
Ms. Tan,

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.660
what does it feel like
to be on your toes?

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.580
Like this.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.100
Give it a try.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.380
It hurts.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:43.940
That's exactly what it feels like.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.860
You have to focus
your whole body's weight on one point.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.500
It takes intense concentration.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.100
But you mustn't practice

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.380
on your toes at home casually.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.660
You could easily sprain your ankle.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.020
So if you really want to learn...

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.740
Ms. Tan.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.580
Ms. Wen.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.780
Why are you still here?

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.260
Don't you have another class?

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.940
Yes.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.460
Get going. Don't be late.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.780
Bye.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.540
Bye.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.460
So, how are you settling in

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.020
since you just got here?

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.780
Pretty good.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.700
The kids here are really serious
about learning.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.500
They even review
on their own after class.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.540
I'm a complete novice

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.460
when it comes to ballet.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.660
I only found out from the other teachers

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.300
that you were

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.940
the principal dancer of Cupid Ballet.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.980
It's really nothing.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.260
Now that I've retired, teaching kids

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.700
brings me a lot of joy.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.820
But we're truly delighted to have you.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.380
Having a master like you join

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.260
makes a qualitative difference

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.900
to any ballet company in the country.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.780
You're too kind, Ms. Wen.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.340
I find it very happy

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.300
to pass on what I've learned

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.620
to these children.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.740
Ms. Tan,

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.660
do you have plans later?

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.460
No.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.660
In that case,

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.820
let's have dinner together.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.020
It'd be a good chance for me

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.980
to fill you in on things here.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.020
And I'd also love

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.700
to get your advice on teaching.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.220
Okay.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.140
I'll go change first then.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.620
Alright.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.340
See you soon.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.900
See you.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.060
Ms. Tan,

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.980
see what you'd like to eat.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.660
I'm fine with anything.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.140
Just nothing with milk.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.620
I'm a bit lactose intolerant.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.860
I'll have this then.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:30.740
The salmon.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:31.540
Okay.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:32.860
Thank you.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:34.740
Thanks.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.900
Then I'll have

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.420
a steak.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:37.780
The steak.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:38.620
And this one.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.220
Okay.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:40.140
That's all.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:41.700
Thank you.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.420
No problem.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.580
I heard you lived abroad
for a long time?

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.620
Just came back recently?

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.340
I spent twelve years in France.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.740
I hear France is a beautiful country.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.580
I've always wanted to go there.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.220
Maybe because I lived there so long,

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.180
I don't really notice that.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:02.460
Well, if I ever

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.660
get the chance to visit France,

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.940
please give me recommendations
for good food and fun places.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:07.980
Sure, no problem.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.180
What made you decide

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.900
to come teach at our training center?

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.700
Mainly because I retired
from my company in France.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.140
Then I returned to my mentor's school.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.820
I wanted to help her

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.540
scout for

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.900
ballet talents here.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:26.700
That's great.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.620
How do you know Feng Rui?

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.020
You've known each other
for a long time, right?

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.020
We were each other's first love.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.780
I'm joking.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.980
Ms. Tan, you're so funny.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.820
I almost thought
you were serious for a second.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.380
You looked completely straight-faced.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.180
Actually, we met

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.740
at a friend's party.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.500
A friend introduced us.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.540
But we didn't really keep in touch

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:06.900
during those twelve years I was away.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.460
I see.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.260
What about you two?

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.420
Have you been married long?

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.340
We...

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:27.300
Over here.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.020
You're here.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.540
Could you open this for me?

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.140
Of course, sir.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:34.980
Let it breathe.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:35.460
Sure.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.100
Is this a surprise?

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.420
You invited my old friend to dinner

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.300
without telling me.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.340
We meet again.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.220
I just didn't have time to tell you.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.340
I ran into Ms. Tan by chance today,

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.180
so we arranged dinner on the spot.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.020
I thought
since you two are good friends,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.300
and now Ms. Tan and I are colleagues,

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.700
we should welcome her properly.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:00.940
Yes, absolutely.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.780
Peiyan is right.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.420
We should have invited you to dinner.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:06.940
That was my fault.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.420
You're all being too kind.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.580
What would you like to eat?

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:13.180
Have you ordered yet?

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.700
We have. Take a look.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:15.140
Okay.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.020
Let... Let me see.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.660
I'm not sure what to get.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:22.900
I'll have the steak.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.580
I would've ordered for you.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:26.380
Same as mine.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:27.940
Alright.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:28.780
One steak, please.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:29.340
Okay.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.860
Ms. Tan, were things smooth for you

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:42.940
all those years in France?

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.540
Everything was fine.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.220
Just took some time
getting used to the food.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:48.900
Right.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.820
It's different for you artists.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.140
You just need to focus on the art.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.300
Not like us.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.060
We're tied down by so many things.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.180
We're not as free as you.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:57.940
To become

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.980
a renowned dancer like Ms. Tan,

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.420
one must have to sacrifice a lot.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.780
Actually, I find teaching children
quite comfortable.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.820
It's something I've always

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.060
wanted to do.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:10.660
Yeah.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.300
I always thought

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.020
you aspired to bigger stages.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
After all, dance means
everything to you.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:21.500
I was thinking,

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.980
if I had even a fraction

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.740
of Ms. Tan's dedication and passion,

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.980
I might have become

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:28.820
a pianist myself.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:31.700
Honestly,

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.220
all these years of persistence

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.380
weren't entirely by choice.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.780
There were many times
it felt boring and tedious.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:41.980
Oh, Rui, did you know?

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.380
Ms. Tan came to our training center

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.220
to help nurture more talents.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.100
Mainly

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.020
to promote my mentor's school.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:51.540
And to help her

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:52.700
scout for

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.700
more ballet talents.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.740
And to train a few more artists

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.860
as accomplished as you.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:01.220
I think

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.300
that's very possible.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.820
There are many

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.020
promising young dancers here
with excellent potential.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.300
Let's toast to Ms. Tan.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:15.820
Okay.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:20.700
Welcome back.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.940
This red wine is from Rui's own winery.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:29.980
How is it?

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:30.580
I know.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.260
Mr. Feng gave me two bottles last time.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:33.500
I think

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.260
its flavor beats
a lot of local French red wines.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.820
Ms. Tan, you gave

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:39.780
such a high praise for our wine.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:40.660
I'm honored.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.540
Are you seeing anyone?

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.460
I've been single.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.020
Guess...

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.340
I've gotten used to
being on my own over the years.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.300
I heard

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.500
French men are quite romantic.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:02.540
Why didn't you find one there?

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.300
Romantic, indeed.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.660
But maybe it just didn't suit me.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.140
Not like you two, a perfect couple.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.100
You've been together
for many years, right?

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:16.980
Yes.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:17.420
We...

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.500
We've been together a long time.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.980
Just haven't had the wedding yet.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:24.500
But

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:25.980
we're planning it now.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.180
It'll be soon.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.220
Then I should propose a toast to you.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:35.700
Here.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.740
Wishing you everlasting happiness.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.420
Thank you.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.700
Excuse me, I need to use the restroom.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:51.100
Okay.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:51.700
Want me to come with you?

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:52.980
No need.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:53.820
You two catch up.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:54.580
Okay.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.780
So, you're good friends now?

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:25.580
Not

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:27.260
exactly.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.820
But Ms. Wen is nice.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.020
I didn't know
you were coming today.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.500
If you feel too awkward,

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.900
I can make an excuse

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.140
and leave soon.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:37.820
It's fine.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:43.700
Ms. Wen loves you very much.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:47.940
She is very good.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:28.020
Le.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:30.340
Wash your hands.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:40.900
What are you doing?

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:42.980
I'm practicing

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.300
how to stand on my toes.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.260
I saw the girls in ballet class

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.460
do it so easily.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.860
You're a boy.
Why are you practicing this?

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.100
Stop fooling around.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.500
You sound just like

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:57.460
that teacher I met.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.260
What's wrong with being a boy?

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.300
There are male ballet dancers too.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.820
You're just being old-fashioned.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.780
I don't like ballet anyway.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.900
And I don't think
it's that nice to watch.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.140
What teacher...

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.100
did you say you met?

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.980
A new teacher at the training center.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:16.620
She's really pretty.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.260
I heard from classmates

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:19.180
that she's

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.500
a famous dancer.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.340
She comes off as...

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.540
Hard to describe,
but she feels very friendly.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:32.460

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.100
How did you find this place?

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:32.180
I like

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.980
exploring quiet spots

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.300
when I go for morning runs sometimes.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.180
So I stumbled upon this place.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.140
♪This posture of steadfast faith♪

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.180
♪Can't hide the weathering
of wind and rain's wraith♪

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.620
♪Let the story settle
in the sea of faces♪

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:50.660
♪Only then can the epilogue
leave its traces♪

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:53.620
♪All those heavy loads we bore♪

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.180
♪Were just time being generous,
nothing more♪

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.780
♪If we look back,
a lingering warmth stays♪

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.140
The food here is great.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.140
Is it okay?

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.580
Definitely.
The food here is always good.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.740
Ms. Tan, is the food to your liking?

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:12.420
It's great.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:13.380
Good, right?

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:19.980
Careful.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:20.660
Okay.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.260
Rui, let's

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.180
take Ms. Tan home later.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:30.540
Don't bother.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.020
Sure.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:32.820
It's fine. I've already called a cab.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.300
No problem. We can share a ride.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:34.660
It's on the way.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:35.300
Don't bother.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.260
The driver is almost here.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.140
Then send me

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.500
Ms. Tan's WeChat info later.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:42.500
I... I don't have it.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:43.860
You...

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:45.580
Twelve years.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:46.260
Right.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.780
Makes sense.
WeChat didn't exist back then.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:49.420
Exactly.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:50.220
Well, perfect timing.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:51.460
Let's add each other today.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:52.620
Okay.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:53.260
We'll scan your QR code.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:54.180
Alright.

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.500
Okay. Added.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:06.820
Got it.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.740
Text us when you get home.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:09.380
Sure.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:10.620
Drive safely.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:11.220
Got a designated driver?

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:12.100
Yes.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:12.980
The cab is here.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:13.580
Right.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.580
The cab's here. I'm off.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:15.300
Okay. Bye.

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:15.740
Bye.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:22.980
Let's go, sir.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:24.900
Bye.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.420
The signal here is terrible.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.060
It's a last-minute dinner
with Ms. Tan today.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.500
Didn't have time to tell you.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:34.900
It's fine.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:37.820
But none of the teachers
at our training center

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.620
expected her to join us.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.780
After all, she's such
an established dance star.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:42.900
Yeah.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.900
Who knows what she was thinking.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.020
But it was nice
to meet up and have a meal.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.700
So you two were first loves?

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.220
When I was chatting with her earlier,

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.220
I asked how you met,

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:01.580
and she said

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:02.980
you were each other's first love.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.540
And she said it
with a completely straight face.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:07.820
It really threw me for a loop.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:09.740
Later she said

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:10.700
she was just joking.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.220
Ms. Tan

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:15.980
has always been quite humorous.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.060
You're acting

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:25.620
a bit strange today.

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:27.980
What's wrong?

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.900
Why did you suddenly
bring up the wedding?

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:37.860
Nothing.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.860
We're in this relationship...

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:41.900
with marriage in mind, right?

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:43.500
It's normal.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.380
It's not that... I just felt...

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.260
it's a bit sudden.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.100
But you looked pretty cool

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:00.820
when you said it.

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:34.780
[Wen Peiyan]
[Moments]

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.620
Every love story is beautiful,

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:37.580
but I

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.700
prefer my own one.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.100
Come to my place after class tonight.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:56.980
Ms. Wen is making the best pasta

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.180
and fresh beef meatballs

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.180
for me tonight.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:02.780
Your stepmom is so good to you.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.180
My real mom

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.940
never asks what I want to eat or do.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:10.980
She just nags about studying
and homework.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:12.460
Nag, nag, nag all day long.

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.420
It's driving me crazy.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.500
Tudou, you're really flexing, huh?

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.180
Only because we're close

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.340
would I not punch you for saying that.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.060
You've known her since first grade.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.980
Why didn't you get her
as your stepmom sooner?

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.060
Like it's up to me.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.660
It depends on my dad.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:31.380
You wouldn't get it.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:32.660
Let's get to the basketball court.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:33.460
It'll be full soon.

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:34.900
Let's go.

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:36.780
Why did you tell on us to the teacher?

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:39.940
Say something.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.780
Aren't you the top student in our grade?

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.420
Cat got your tongue?

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:47.140
Exactly.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.260
You copied homework.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.060
That is wrong.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.860
When did you see us copying homework?

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:54.460
Right.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.300
Did we copy?

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:57.620
What are you doing?

00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.460
What, you're scared?

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:00.980
Just pretend you didn't see anything.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:02.820
Ren Zhexi's family is really tough.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:03.940
His dad is like a mob boss.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.020
I don't dare mess with them.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:06.700
You should just drop it too.

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:08.500
We can't take them.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:09.940
Let's go.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.140
Let's go get that pasta.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:12.020
I forgot to tell you.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.500
My dad is tough too!

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:14.980
What are you guys doing?

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.300
For this Food and Drinks Fair,

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:26.020
I'm planning to organize
a professional masterclass.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:27.660
For the masterclass,

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.300
I'm thinking of inviting Mark

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.060
to be the lead instructor.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.020
How many people do you want to invite?

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.300
Mark is great. Perfect.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:36.700
Give me a rough estimate.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.260
Hold on a second.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:38.020
Okay.

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:43.740
Hello, Ms. Hu.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:49.980
Did you come to school to fight?

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:52.540
Why were you fighting?

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.060
What happened?

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:56.540
You...?

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:57.420
Ms. Hu.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.420
What happened with Feng Lexuan?

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.220
Fighting.

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:04.900
Ren Zhexi!

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:07.260
What is wrong?

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:08.980
They were bullying Yang Zihuan.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:09.660
And Yang Zihuan...

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:10.620
You hit us first,

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:11.460
and you think you're in the right?

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:12.100
How can you say that?

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.100
Who was bullying him?

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.060
It was the three of you
ganging up on us!

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:15.620
Ren Zhexi!

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:16.620
Enough!

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:16.820
Shut up.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.140
Ren Zhexi, have you been
bullying other students?

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.380
No, Dad.

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.300
Say that again!

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.020
Ms. Hu,

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.660
is there any evidence that Ren Zhexi
was bullying other students?

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.180
The spot where the fight happened
isn't covered by surveillance cameras.

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:28.380
So it's just a one-sided story then.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.940
They are all one-sided stories then.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.180
Alright, everyone.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.540
Now that we're all here,

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.500
I'll tell you

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.980
the school's preliminary decision.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.220
Each of you will write
a 600-word reflection

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.260
and receive a major demerit.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:41.860
Madam,

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.260
why do we have to write reflections too?

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.460
They were the ones bullying Yang Zihuan.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.060
We saw it and went to stop them.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:48.740
Is that wrong?

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.180
You're writing reflections

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.860
because you fought at school.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.140
As for your claim

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:54.860
that Ren Zhexi bullied Yang Zihuan,

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:55.820
we have no evidence.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:56.860
I want you all to go home

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:58.060
and seriously reflect

00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.740
on your mistakes.

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.700
Hand in your reflections to me
first thing tomorrow morning.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:02.700
Understood?

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:03.820
Understood.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:06.340
Alright. You can all go home now.

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:14.500
Dad,

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:15.740
why?

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:18.220
They were the ones bullying Yang Zihuan.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.780
We went over to stop them.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.620
And now we're the ones in the wrong?

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.260
It's not fair!

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.220
Why are we being punished too?

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:28.820
Look at you.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:33.460
Where did the fight happen?

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.740
Up ahead. I'll take you there.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:37.420
Okay.

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:39.900
You fought right here?

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:40.620
Yes.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:45.740
Dad,

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:47.900
you believe me, right?

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.020
Of course.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:53.660
Alright. Let's go home.

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:54.540
Let's go.

00:25:58.580 --> 00:25:59.380
Today

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.820
marks the fifth anniversary
of Tianlu's listing.

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:02.900
A big day.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.140
For these five years,

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.740
everyone has been diligent
and dedicated.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.660
I've seen all your contributions

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.340
to Tianlu.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.500
In the next five years,

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.540
we will aim even higher.

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:17.580
Alright.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.260
I have some good news to share.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.860
Mr. Jin, please.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.660
After a unanimous board vote,

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:31.460
we've decided to acquire

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:32.180
Soler Winery,

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.860
located in the southeastern suburbs

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.060
of Melbourne, Australia.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:37.940
This truly allows us

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.260
to produce and sell our own wine.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:41.980
- Great!
- Great.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:42.900
That's good.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.180
This is just a small step

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.180
in Tianlu's next five-year plan.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.540
Exploring this business model

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:50.620
means

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.420
Tianlu's future holds
many possibilities.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:56.220
Good.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:57.180
Here.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:58.460
Ms. Han,

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:00.220
arrange for everyone

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:04.340
to get a bottle of Soler's

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.020
Cabernet Sauvignon dry red wine

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.220
as a reward today.

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:08.580
Got it, Ms. Gao.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:09.220
- Thank you, Ms. Gao.
- Thank you, Ms. Gao!

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:10.700
Thank you, Ms. Gao.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:12.140
Who's that?

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:13.380
Height, 145 cm.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:14.980
Let's measure your shoulder width.

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:15.940
Chest out. Head up.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:16.780
Okay.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:17.700
Her neck condition looks average.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.020
Ting, she's a bit nervous.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:21.140
Shoulder width, 37 cm.

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.420
Arm length, 66 cm.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:25.060
Let's measure your arm span.

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:25.580
Hands.

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:27.060
142 cm.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:28.540
Very good.

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:30.140
She shows promise.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:33.340
Qu Zhen.

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.180
Can you show us

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:36.740
some moves you can do?

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:53.100
Nice.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:55.700
Madam.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.380
You live very far away.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.700
You probably
don't know much about ballet.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.140
How did you hear about our school?

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:09.420
My... My Mandarin isn't very good.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.460
My mom's Mandarin isn't very good.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.260
But in our village,

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.540
everyone says my Mandarin
is the most standard.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.580
It's okay. Take your time.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:22.620
We can understand you.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.500
This is the first time my mom and I

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.460
have left the mountains.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.220
We took the train, bus,

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:32.780
and subway.

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.580
All for the first time.

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:36.420
On the way here,

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.780
I saw so many cars.

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.060
Even more than the cows
and sheep back home.

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.220
So how did you

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.340
and your mom hear about us?

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.380
Old Sir told us.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.700
He even paid for our trip here.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.340
Old Sir is our...

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:55.380
Qu Zhen,

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.180
explain to the teachers

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.780
who Old Sir is.

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.860
Old Sir is an elder from our village.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.860
He knows many things and has seen much.

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.740
He's the one who told me about ballet.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.060
So you've never
learned ballet before, right?

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:14.900
Then...

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.420
Do you know what ballet is?

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:19.100
It's dancing.

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:21.100
It's different
from the dancing back home.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:23.740
I'm not sure why I want to learn it.

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.540
Old Sir has some ballet magazines.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.340
I tried to copy the people
in the pictures, standing on my toes.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:31.220
When I stretch my arms and spin,

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.220
it feels so free.

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.620
It makes me happy. Old Sir is happy too.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:36.780
That's wonderful.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:38.460
We all understand

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:39.860
Qu Zhen's situation now.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:40.740
Come on.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.340
Let's hear everyone's opinions.

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:44.860
The proportion is twelve.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.660
Her height and leg length ratios
meet the requirements.

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.540
With no prior training,

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.300
she managed to get on demi-pointe

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.340
with her own ability

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.020
and held her balance briefly.

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.500
She does have good natural aptitude.

00:29:58.580 --> 00:29:59.580
However, I still don't think

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.460
she meets our admission standards.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.940
There are plenty of children
with a bit of talent

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:04.780
like her.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.220
Besides, she has
several significant shortcomings.

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:10.500
I agree with Ms. Guan.

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.980
The child is indeed a bit old.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.060
She's already eleven.

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.140
That is a real shame.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.060
Her arch isn't good either.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:19.940
Her flexibility needs work too.

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.340
Fine for casual dancing.

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:23.140
But I doubt

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.620
she can make a career of it.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:25.460
It's just too difficult.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.620
I actually think this child

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:29.740
has a better feel

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.780
for ballet than most people.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.740
What is the purpose of dance?

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.100
Must it always be about achievement?

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.460
Can't liking it, finding joy in it,
enjoying it

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.540
also be an achievement?

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:47.420
Dab it.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:48.540
Slowly.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.780
You need to clean the wound properly.

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.740
Why are you back so early today?

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.260
There was a bit of trouble at school.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:57.620
I brought Le home first.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:58.700
Trouble?

00:30:58.780 --> 00:30:59.260
Bear with it.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:30:59.740
Nothing serious.

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:00.460
What happened?

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:01.740
Nothing serious.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:10.900
What happened?

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:12.780
It's nothing.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:14.140
Just a minor incident.

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.140
What happened?

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.060
What's going on?

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:22.860
It's fine.

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:24.180
Just...

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.420
Some students had a conflict.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.580
It's okay. I'll handle it.

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:35.780
Feng Lexuan,

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:37.700
tell me

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:38.700
what happened.

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:45.100
Speak.

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:47.500
Well,

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.260
those three repeaters in our class

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.420
were bullying Yang Zihuan.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.940
Duan Xiyan and I couldn't just stand by.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.140
So we went to help him.

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:57.780
They pushed me first.

00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:58.700
That's why I fought back.

00:31:59.060 --> 00:31:59.660
And then?

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:01.660
The teacher made us write reflections
and gave us a major demerit.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.340
Write reflections and a major demerit?

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:06.420
That was the teacher's decision?

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.100
It's okay, Mom. It's just a scrape.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:14.020
I'll take care of it.

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:14.380
You...

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:14.780
Step aside.

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:15.820
Let me see.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:19.340
Look at this.

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:20.500
Ms. Tan,

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.860
you were the principal dancer
in a world-class troupe.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.060
You've achieved great success.

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.420
Of course you can say that.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.620
But for most people

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.060
who choose ballet,

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.060
achieving results
is a very important part.

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.140
It represents

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.340
the reward for all their hard work.

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:37.980
Tamara Rojo.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:39.580
I believe you all know her.

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:41.220
She became the principal dancer

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:42.900
at Royal Ballet at twenty-three.

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.580
She's one of those youngest
principal dancers in the ballet world.

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:46.740
But compared with

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.660
other renowned ballet dancers globally,

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:51.620
her physical attributes weren't great.

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.980
Her body proportions aren't outstanding.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.020
But she has exceptional stamina.

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.460
She can do highly technical ballet moves

00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.460
and character portrayals.

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.220
That's why she's recognized

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.780
as a virtuoso of ballet technique.

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:05.660
She once said something.

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:07.100
Ballet is the fairest art.

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:08.780
You get

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.620
exactly what you put in.

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.500
So, are there truly fixed standards

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.300
for what makes an excellent dancer?

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.540
Some might have great physical gifts,

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.020
some superb technique,

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.900
others strong dramatic interpretation.

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.100
But I believe

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.900
this child has great physical potential.

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:31.180
If she dedicates herself deeply,

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.260
I'm sure

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:34.820
she will achieve something.

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.140
Aren't dreams
about believing in the impossible?

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:39.340
Well said.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.060
A dream is about believing

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:42.220
in what seems impossible.

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:44.220
Our school

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.260
isn't just a place to learn ballet.

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.300
It's a place

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.220
where we strive to help children
realize their dreams.

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:51.820
That is our founding principle.

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.540
Alright. I've heard all your opinions.

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:56.940
I think Qu Zhen

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:58.900
is worth cultivating.

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.860
Her weaknesses are as apparent

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:03.060
as her strengths.

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:05.780
I also believe her strengths
outweigh her weaknesses.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:07.260
Ms. Zhuang,

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:09.020
I believe our school

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:10.580
is a professional institution.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.300
So let's follow the standard procedure.

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:14.860
I propose

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:16.860
Qu Zhen take the entrance exam tomorrow.

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.060
If she passes,

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.420
we'll accept her.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:20.860
What does everyone think?

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:24.060
What are you going
to test her on tomorrow?

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.540
I won't make it
unfairly difficult for her.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.620
I saw she can already

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:30.700
get up on demi-pointe.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:31.740
But it was too brief

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:32.460
to assess properly.

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:33.420
Tomorrow,

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:34.580
if she can perform

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.220
all the required entrance exam moves

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:37.700
correctly and standardly,

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.260
holding each
for no less than one minute,

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:41.700
we'll consider her qualified.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:43.020
Okay.

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:44.220
Alright.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:45.620
It's settled then.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:46.940
Done.

00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:49.980
What's wrong?

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:53.100
Ms. Zhuang,

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:54.940
we won't be enrolling.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.140
You don't even know our decision yet.

00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:58.820
Why are you giving up now?

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:00.220
Qu Zhen.

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.220
We have no money.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:03.060
Let's go.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:05.060
My mom

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:06.660
saw the fee schedule.

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:08.060
The tuition is too expensive.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.100
We won't be enrolling.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.060
Don't worry about the tuition.

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:15.940
We offer financial aid.

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:18.980
If Qu Zhen works hard enough,

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:20.860
we can waive the tuition fees.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.220
And

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.180
we have dormitories.

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.740
You can live here without any cost.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:27.900
We can study here

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.100
without paying tuition.

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:30.340
Really?

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:32.180
Ms. Zhuang, can we really

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:33.140
study here

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:33.900
for free?

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:36.300
Yes.

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:39.380
Thank Ms. Zhuang now.

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:40.780
Thank you, Ms. Zhuang.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:42.380
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Ms. Zhuang.

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:43.140
No problem.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.700
But there is one condition.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:45.820
What is it?

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.020
If you pass the exam tomorrow,

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:49.980
you can study here for free.

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:51.060
What's on the exam?

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.820
What dance moves can you do now?

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:55.340
How long can you hold them?

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.020
I don't know. I've never counted.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.220
But they're probably not very standard.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:04.700
I can give you

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:06.300
a special training session tonight.

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.100
You seem

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:18.580
preoccupied.

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:24.140
No.

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:27.340
Honestly,

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.100
I just said it offhand

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:30.540
that day.

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.220
If you've changed your mind,

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:33.820
there's still time.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:35.020
How could I?

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.060
Have you told Le?

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:39.500
Tell Le?

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:41.940
About us.

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:46.500
Should we tell him?

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.020
I...

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:48.620
I haven't decided yet.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:49.540
Maybe

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:51.780
we should

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:53.420
try things out first?

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.860
Sounds like you're the one
having a hard time with it.

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.180
I am having a hard time with it.

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.580
From now on, I'll be

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.820
a free piano teacher and nanny.

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.220
You're getting quite the deal.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:08.140
Le will be so happy.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:11.860
I hope he is happy too.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.940
I'll come to your place often

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:16.580
to take care of him.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:18.980
And

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:20.820
look after you too.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:50.500
Do you like it?

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:51.980
Yes.

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:53.140
I loved it too

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.860
the first time I saw a dance studio

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:55.780
as a child.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.700
Madam, can I really learn ballet here?

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:04.420
As long as you truly like it

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:05.740
and are willing, you can.

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:13.340
Alright.

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:15.260
You can stand like that

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:16.380
thanks to your natural

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:17.340
physical strength.

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.180
It's normal you can't hold it for long.

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:20.780
Because you haven't had
professional training.

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:22.980
When we practice

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.060
working on pointe,

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:25.420
we rely on the shoe's support

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:27.820
and strong ankle strength.

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:29.700
But don't worry.

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:30.940
This isn't on tomorrow's exam.

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.420
I can teach you something useful.

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.460
Some tips for the basic moves.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:36.700
Okay, Madam.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:37.620
They're easy to learn.

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:39.820
Place your hands on the barre.

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:41.260
Feet together.

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:43.020
Get up on demi-pointe.

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:45.100
Can you do it?

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:49.820
Get up.

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:51.140
Head up a little.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:52.500
Shoulders down.

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.020
Heels pressing down.

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:20.260
Very good.

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:22.140
Hands back a bit.

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:23.900
That's good.

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.220
One, two, three, down.

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:36.060
Tired?

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:37.140
Take a break.

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:39.140
You should be fine

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.220
if you

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:42.260
do this tomorrow. Don't be nervous.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:46.020
Ms. Tan, you're so kind to me.
Thank you.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:49.660
I just want to protect
your original love for ballet.

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:51.540
Original love?

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.300
Old Sir said he hopes I can always dance

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.300
listening to the voice in my heart.

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:57.660
Is it the same meaning?

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:01.380
Pretty much.

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:03.780
I definitely will.

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.060
I love ballet the most.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.380
Before I met Old Sir,

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:10.060
my favorite was the dancing
from back home.

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:11.420
After I met him,

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.100
ballet became my favorite.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:14.700
I heard you say

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.940
Old Sir is an elder from your village.

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:21.100
People from my village

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:22.580
go to him with all their problems.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.580
He's a very reliable person.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.780
Ms. Tan, thank you so much.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.620
Back home, we dance when we're happy.

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:33.020
And I'm very happy right now.

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:34.580
Can I dance?

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:35.500
Of course.

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:52.100
It's OK.

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:53.980
Did you get the phone number?

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:54.380
Hey!

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:55.540
Want to learn about the Volleyball Club?

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:57.300
Next one.

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:01.380
Next one.

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:10.460
Hello.

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:11.860
It's you.

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.340
The ride-sharing driver.

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.180
I'm your savior
who found your dance shoes

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:17.100
and saved your career.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:20.100
You know each other?

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:21.900
The day of my Queen Ballet audition,

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.780
he took a shortcut when driving me.

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:24.660
If it weren't for him,

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:25.700
I would have been finished.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:26.940
I remember you telling me that story.

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:28.220
What a coincidence.

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:29.940
You want to learn ballet?

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:31.380
Just passing by.

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.260
And I saw someone I know.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.180
Your savior.

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:36.260
Want to sign up?

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:36.940
Can I?

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.540
I'm quite interested in ballet.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:39.940
Is that not allowed?

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:42.340
Can I?

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:44.460
Sure.

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:46.500
Fill out this form.

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:47.820
Tomorrow, 9 AM,

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:48.900
at the ballet studio.

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:50.420
But let's make it clear.

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:51.540
I'm very strict.

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:53.220
I'm afraid you might not keep up.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:54.820
No problem.

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:56.340
I like being treated strictly.

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:26.460
What are you doing?

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:27.740
I'm... I'm practicing.

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:29.980
Ouch, ouch!

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:30.580
Practice a bit longer.

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:31.220
No more. I'm done.

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.220
Just practice a bit more.

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:03.900
Lower. Return to first position.
