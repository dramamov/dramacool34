00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.600
Why is she here?

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.040
How did he know I was here?

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.080
Miss Nan

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.480
No

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.960
Madam

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.240
You're up

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.600
Madam

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.520
You got into character fast

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.120
Are you looking for a book?

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.320
It's nothing

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.040
I was just about to go to the front hall

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.600
We'll do the tea-serving ceremony soon

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.800
With me here,

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.000
you don't need to be afraid

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.920
Then you

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.720
Let's go together

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.960
Civil officials really are sly

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.000
Father

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.840
Chenxiao and I

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.320
are here to serve you tea

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.040
Father, please have tea

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.840
Chenxiao

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.200
Kneel down

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.440
No need to kneel

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.440
Get up

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.640
Third daughter-in-law

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.920
Red envelope

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.680
Take it

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.680
Thank you, Father

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.800
Chenxiao

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.680
Now that you're married in

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.440
we're all family now

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.520
From now on

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.240
you and Yu'er

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.040
must support each other

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.000
Yes

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.480
I will remember

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.000
Everyone, you may leave

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.120
Eldest and third sons

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.160
stay behind

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.200
Madam

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.280
Go back and rest first

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.440
I'll head back then

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.600
Knows her manners

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.760
Seriously, Father?

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.720
She didn't even kneel during the tea ceremony

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.720
Miss Nan is from a military family

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.200
she's different from us

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.160
so she's naturally more lively

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.840
She married me

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.600
I've already wronged her enough

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.920
I don't want to restrict her over trivial things

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.720
From now on

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.320
Father and eldest brother,

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.120
please don't mind her words or actions

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.760
Judging by her behavior today

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.840
she's easy to get along with

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.080
In the future

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.240
I'll spend more time writing in my room

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.400
and painting

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.240
and just avoid interacting with her

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.440
That's fine by me

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.960
I'll just stay in my room carving wood

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.200
I won't interact with her

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.640
I think Lord Rui is a good man

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.360
Good? Really?

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.200
Didn't you see he kept his two sons behind?

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.240
They're probably talking bad about me

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.440
Civil officials say one thing to your face

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.440
and another behind your back

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.160
Chenxiao

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.920
Wait

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.160
Elder sister-in-law

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.320
Do you need something?

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.560
From now on

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.200
we're sisters-in-law

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.320
Here in the Rui Residence

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.840
if there's anything you don't understand

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.960
or want to ask

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.160
just come to me

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.840
I know all the affairs inside and out here

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.200
I'm familiar with everything

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.520
There's nothing I need to know

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.160
I'm not planning to manage things

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.680
You're just afraid of trouble, right?

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.480
I've managed the household for years

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.520
and never had any real trouble

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.840
It's just the socializing in official circles

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.120
Now that you're married in

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.080
you should mingle with the other ladies

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.720
I have a bad temper

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.240
I can't do that

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.160
Those noble ladies

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.440
are all just pretending

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.560
You

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.520
just need to keep up appearances

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.880
By the way

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.880
I made you some herbal food to replenish your blood

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.280
On your first day of marriage

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.600
you must take good care of yourself

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.120
A woman's body

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.200
is delicate

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.200
I'm quite healthy

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.360
Maybe you should let Rui Yu have it

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.360
He needs it more

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.480
Why haven't you changed how you address him?

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.280
Change to what?

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.800
You can't call Xiao Yu by name anymore

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.960
You should call him

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.640
husband

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.680
Isn't that too formal?

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.680
Try calling him once

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.400
What's wrong?

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.080
He's right in front of you

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.120
You can say it now

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.080
Come here, Xiao Yu

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.280
Elder sister-in-law wants me to change how I address you

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.320
You two newlyweds can talk

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.560
I'll go to the storeroom

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.600
Chenxiao

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.080
Come find me later

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.200
About changing how you address him

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.600
No rush

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.800
Take your time to get used to it

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:21.840
I need to go to the palace

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.880
You'll be home alone

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.040
I'll be home alone

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.520
That's great

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.760
Once you leave

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.880
things will be easier

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.320
Tell me

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.880
Are you letting me go out or not?

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:54.720
Servant

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.760
I wouldn't dare

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.200
Imperial Brother told you to watch me

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.920
but didn't say to keep me locked up

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.160
So why can't I go out?

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.680
Your Majesty said

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:02.760
Does it look good?

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.040
It looks good

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.880
I always tell you to read more

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.320
but at crucial moments you only say "looks good"

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.200
If Yu brother were here

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.640
he'd definitely say

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.400
"On a fine day, flowers bloom beautifully"

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.400
"Spring beauty misses the flowers' time"

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.360
Where's the paste?

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.760
This, Princess

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:30.680
Close your eyes

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:36.760
Princess

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:37.960
Don't move.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.640
These two vases

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.720
were gifts from my Imperial Brother.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.400
If they get broken,

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.640
do you know what will happen?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.160
You know the consequences.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.000
Princess

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.880
Princess

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.200
Princess, slow down.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.120
Princess

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:55.920
Your Highness

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.480
Your Highness

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.880
Is my Imperial Brother inside?

00:08:59.080 --> 00:08:59.720
Your Highness

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.400
Are you

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.960
here to see Your Majesty?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.920
Is my Imperial Brother discussing matters
with Rui Yu?

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.640
Well...

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.120
Your Highness, Your Highness

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:11.960
Rui Yu

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.200
Lord Rui

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.200
So, Your Majesty means

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.720
to send someone to escort Hou Xian
back to Pingxiang

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:46.640
and

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.160
help him ascend the throne.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.200
I've thought it over,

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.640
and it's best to send you.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:53.920
I

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.760
will not fail Your Majesty's trust.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.720
I will depart early tomorrow.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.240
To outsiders,

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.440
just say you're going to Pingxiang
to look for books.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.520
Rest and prepare first.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.440
Didn't I grant you a month's leave
when I bestowed the marriage?

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.760
Wait until then.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.600
Go after that.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.560
Then I'll return home today

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.680
and have my family prepare
for the journey.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.440
I will make sure to conceal
Hou Xian's

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.480
safe return.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.600
Nan Chenxiao is from a military family.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.200
With her by your side,
you'll be safer.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.240
You'll be more secure.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.920
This trip is dangerous.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.920
I don't want any more innocent people...

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.120
Your Majesty

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.320
Lord Rui

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.520
Princess Chunxi

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.280
is blocking the Imperial Garden gate.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.400
Your- Your Majesty

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.080
Then I'll take my leave.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.280
Go ahead.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.000
Wait.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.120
Remember to prepare Nan Chenxiao's
travel bag.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:43.680
I

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.640
Rui Yu

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.680
accept the order.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:46.720
Lord Rui

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.680
Lord Rui

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.280
Please follow me, Lord Rui.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.360
Thank you, Eunuch Li.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.200
Rui Yu

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:55.600
Rui Yu

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.400
Slow down.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.200
Princess

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:58.760
Be careful.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:10:59.960
Rui Yu

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.120
What do you want from me?

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.520
I'm not looking for you.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:08.800
Rui Yu

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.400
Rui Yu

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:11.800
Come.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.320
Play with me, Rui Yu.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.640
The arrow is nocked,

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.520
it must be released.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.040
Lord Rui, Lord Rui, Lord Rui

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.800
Minister Liu

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.240
Well...

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.680
Yesterday at the banquet,
it was rushed.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.640
I didn't get a chance

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.160
to properly thank you.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.520
You're too polite, Minister Liu.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.520
But I have things to do today.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:42.880
How about...

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.520
Lord Rui

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.600
You have time for a few words, right?

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.560
Well, I...

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.200
prepared a gift for you.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.440
I meant to give it to you
after court.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.520
But you hurried home so quickly.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.440
I understand.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.480
What is it?

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.040
I found a rare book for you.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.280
Read it carefully at home.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.800
Thank you, Minister Liu.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.000
Well then,

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:09.880
farewell.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.600
Farewell.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.040
Rui Yu

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.440
Let's go.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.360
This way, Minister Liu.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.080
Princess

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.480
It's all your fault.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.280
You walk too slow.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.640
I couldn't catch up to Rui Yu again.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.640
Did he come by here just now?

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:36.960
Seems like it.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.680
This Rui Residence

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.520
is at least three times
the size of our Jiangjun Fu.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:49.760
How is it going?

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.520
Young Master, Young Master!

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.320
Watch closely.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.400
The sunlight is right here now.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.040
It will shift in this direction.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.360
This agarwood of mine

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.320
can't be exposed directly to sunlight.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.120
Keep an eye on the sunlight for me.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:00.960
Maintain the temperature.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.040
Not too high, not too low.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:03.840
So, should we...

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.280
Just move it to the storeroom, right?

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.280
What do you know?

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:07.800
Is the storeroom ventilated?

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.680
What if this fine wood gets damp?

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.160
Just keep watch for me.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.120
It's only three pieces of wood.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.400
If you still mess this up,

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.600
see how I'll deal with you.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.120
Yes, yes, Young Master.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:17.520
Alright.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.160
Keep a close watch.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.120
I'm off to walk my birds.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.840
Is the Rui family's eldest son always this free?

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.720
This Rui family's eldest son

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.560
is a real playboy.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.360
He has some woodcarving skills.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.280
Loves collecting rare wood.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.280
Expert in bug fighting and bird walking.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.520
He's quite the rascal.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.560
So that means

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.280
this wood is really important to him.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.120
How's Rui Yu's relationship with his elder brother?

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.440
They're actually pretty close.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.200
Seems polite and respectful.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.000
Look at this.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.400
First day after the wedding.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.400
The bride must serve her in-laws at meals.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:59.520
So,

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.720
I need wood to cook, right?

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:04.720
Look over there.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.000
It's ready to use.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.520
If you're acting, do the whole act.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.600
I've followed all the rules.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.960
But they still don't like me.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.720
Then I can get a mutual divorce.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.880
Haven't seen Rui Yu's second brother.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.440
No idea what he's like.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.480
I couldn't find out about his second brother.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.680
But I heard he's a scholar.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.000
Find a way

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.520
to get those two boys out of here.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:26.880
Yes.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:29.960
Sir.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:39.960
Smells so good.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.160
Is that the smell of cooking?

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.640
Doesn't really smell like it.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.640
I just bought it.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.320
Top-grade agarwood.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.040
I haven't even warmed it up yet.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.320
How did it get burned to charcoal?

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.520
Just kick out whoever burned it.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.400
Let me ask you,

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.160
who blew up my kitchen?

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.320
How would I know?

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:20.440
It was me.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.880
Not your fault, Nan Chenxiao.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.640
Why are you yelling?

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:26.720
What's wrong?

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:27.720
Did something serious happen?

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:28.560
What's going on?

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.520
My wood

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.080
I burned it.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.400
And I blew up the kitchen.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.560
Agarwood.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:38.800
You're not wrong.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.000
I didn't...

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.760
It's about the wood again.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.320
Arguing all day over this pile of wood.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.680
Always bickering.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:46.920
What's the point of arguing?

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.040
It's not just some lousy wood.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.600
Eighty taels!

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:52.760
That's right, Dad.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.200
Eighty taels!

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.400
Why haven't you kicked me out yet?

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:57.640
Eighty taels.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.320
Where did you get eighty taels?

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.600
Didn't you give me all your money last time?

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.880
Nan Chenxiao bought it.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.360
They came to collect the money.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.520
So I just paid it.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.240
Then why are you crying?

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.560
You didn't buy it.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.120
Elder brother paid for it.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.040
So it's definitely his.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.320
What's wrong with elder brother?

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:25.840
I...

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:27.600
This...

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:28.760
This...

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:37.040
Nan Chenxiao burned the wood she bought.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.080
I thought something serious happened.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:48.760
No,

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.440
Why can't you all figure this out?

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.440
Elder brother.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.960
Spent eighty taels

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.880
on two fine pieces of agarwood.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.240
Elder brother paid.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.800
So it's definitely his.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:16:59.880
Then I went to cook.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.840
I used it as firewood.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.680
And blew up the kitchen.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.920
I made such a big mistake.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.800
Aren't you going to react?

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.440
I'm not angry.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.200
Don't worry.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.360
You should be angry!

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.480
If you're not mad, I'm furious!

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.720
Alright, alright.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.480
If it's nothing serious, let's disperse.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.560
Yu'er,

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.000
take your third sister-in-law

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:30.840
back to her room.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.200
Let her wash her face.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.000
Look,

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.360
she's filthy.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.520
Don't dismiss us yet, Dad.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.200
Elder brother.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.480
Sorry.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.680
I apologize to you for Nan Chenxiao.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:45.680
No,

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.080
it's all my fault.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:53.840
It's fine, it's fine.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:54.280
Nan Chenxiao.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.480
Darn it, come back here!

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.680
Agarwood.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.600
It's meant to be burned anyway.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.120
Don't take it too seriously.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.000
Who cares about that stuff?

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:14.880
You're cooking?

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.160
I'll wait for you in the flower hall.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.280
Wash your face first.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.080
Are civil officials always this tolerant?

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.880
What a troublesome time.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.680
Cooked with elder brother's agarwood.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.640
Gives a unique flavor.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.560
Just didn't control the heat well.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.760
Ended up blowing up the kitchen.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.240
Burned with agarwood,

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.600
the scent is truly unique.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.400
Sometimes, a little indulgence is good.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:17.680
Thank you for your hard work.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.400
You.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.880
Don't you have anything to say?

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.200
What do you think I should say?

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.600
Like kicking me out of the Rui Residence,

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:29.840
or

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.720
punishing me with family rules.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.120
You just married in.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.560
It's normal to be unfamiliar with many things.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.160
Just send an apology gift to Eldest Brother later.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.160
I'll get you some silver.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.280
Spring Light Poetry Collection.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.680
A colleague just gifted me this rare copy.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.560
I haven't had time to put it in the study.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.320
Is there anything wrong with it?

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.440
It should be a good book.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.400
I'm not—

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.000
I didn't—

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:15.920
You, to me—

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:16.920
Yes.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.920
I have things to do, I'll leave first.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.800
Be careful.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:25.600
Slow down, slow down.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.600
Get on the last carriage.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:28.720
Watch your step.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.600
Sister-in-law.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.720
And also,

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.920
Isn't this giving you face?

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.760
Let Father-in-law know,

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.640
our family is different from others.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.640
Whether civil official or military officer,

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.360
we treat everyone equally.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.000
I don't think so.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.400
I thought civil and military could coexist peacefully.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.920
But in the end, conflict is inevitable.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:55.480
Madam.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.840
Are you angry?

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.400
Isn't it obvious whether I'm angry?

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.200
Can you be more straightforward as a man?

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.120
If—

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.360
you don't want to change how you address me,

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.880
there's no need to rush.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.840
Can you stop being two-faced?

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.200
I've already called you that, and now you say this?

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:19.560
That—

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.120
Spring Light Poetry Collection.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.720
It's really not mine.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:24.400
I—

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.640
What's wrong with a man reading this?

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.120
What does it have to do with me?

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.640
No.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:33.680
I'm about to be exposed.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.160
The whole family will die.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:36.720
It's fine.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.040
I don't care.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.400
Father, Mother.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.240
I'm back.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.760
I can't accept such courtesy.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.040
I, Rui Yu, your son-in-law,

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.280
greet Father-in-law and Mother-in-law.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:09.960
No need for formalities.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:14.520
Junior—

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:16.560
Sister.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.040
Junior Sister's husband.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.160
Chenxiao.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.120
You've been married for years,

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.880
yet never came back to see me.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.240
This is your husband, Rui Yu?

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.760
No, it's not—

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.520
The husband's family is busy.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.080
Only now is there time to visit you?

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.400
It's all my fault.

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.840
I couldn't bring my wife home sooner.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.520
It's fine.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.840
As long as you two are happy,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.360
I'm at ease.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.000
Since you're back,

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.240
stay and eat together.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.440
Stay for a meal.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.840
Qiao Youyi is here too.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.440
I'll make you some delicious food.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.120
Rui Yu,

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.280
go to the front first.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.360
How did the thing I asked you about yesterday go?

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:06.880
Rui Yu,

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.520
That Laojun Cypress in front is centuries old.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.240
Can't bear to trim it.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.480
Mother-in-law takes great care of it.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.080
Are you sure there's no problem?

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.800
One dose and he'll be just like Father-in-law.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.400
But—

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.600
Isn't this too much?

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.680
Too much? Darn it.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.080
If I'm exposed, the whole family dies.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.440
Nice color on your clothes.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.160
Qiao Youyi.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.960
Rui Yu, try this.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:36.760
And this one.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.200
Mother made them all herself.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.680
Thank you, Mother-in-law.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.360
He didn't do anything to you, right?

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.680
What could he do?

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.320
This is—

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.160
Wine brewed by your mother-in-law.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:51.640
Come.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.240
Have a drink.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:52.920
Father-in-law.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.080
A toast to you.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.240
Good.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.240
Junior Sister's husband.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.160
Come.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.520
First time meeting Junior Sister's husband today.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.800
Military officers always drink three cups in a row.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:11.280
Come.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.160
A toast to you.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.240
I—

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.280
I can't drink much.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:15.960
Come on.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:26.840
One more.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.320
Here, the third cup.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.280
I'll finish it.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.400
We've reached the study.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.840
Here, here, here.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.200
Where are you going?

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.280
Going to sleep on the bed.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.720
I'll sleep on the couch.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.560
That's the couch.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.480
Your couch.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.600
Alright.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.080
Very good.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.280
Rui Yu.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:42.680
Rui Yu.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.240
Who told you to be a traitor?

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.560
Cut off your descendants.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.600
It's justice for heaven.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.200
Nan Chenxiao

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.200
Nan Chenxiao

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:22.360
Come out quickly.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.280
Come out, come out.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.120
What's wrong?

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.040
I just remembered,

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.240
this morning,

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.760
your elder brother's letter arrived.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:31.600
It's for you.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.480
A letter?

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
He clearly wrote this before leaving home.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.240
He's already fallen on the battlefield.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.320
How could he still send a letter back?

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:41.680
Mother.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.000
Open it and take a look.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.520
What did your brother write?

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.440
Soon, I will go to the border to defend the city.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.640
Missing Father and Mother in my heart,

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.440
I wrote these words in this letter.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.400
I hope you always stay diligent.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.240
Though military officers are now in decline at court,

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.840
we must not lose our sense of righteousness.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.800
I know your frustration hiding as a daughter.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.480
Even so,

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.840
in all you do,

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.600
strive to be open and upright.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.320
Only then is your warm heart not wasted.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.840
What did your brother write?

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:24.880
Open and upright.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.240
What I just did

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.400
really goes against my brother's teachings.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.360
What did your brother say in the letter?

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.760
He said he's doing well at the border.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.720
He told you not to worry.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.480
Why is it always the same words?

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.000
He never says anything else.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.760
How is he eating?

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.680
How is he living?

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.520
I'm really worried.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.320
Mother.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.800
It's getting late.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.120
Go back and rest early.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.240
I almost forgot.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.600
I haven't taken the medicine Qiao Youyi gave me.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:01.800
Then I'll be going.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.400
Let me see you off.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.920
No need to see me off.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.760
Take good care of Rui Yu.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.480
Rest early.

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.800
Go back quickly.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.320
Got it, Mother.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.400
Don't...
