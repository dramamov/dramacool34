00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.500
(Lu Man, Liang Yi's stand-in)

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.659
Sorry.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.100
Did I startle you?

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.580
Mrs. Lin is truly stunning.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.260
No wonder Mr. Lin can't forget you.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.859
Congratulations.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.220
I'm Liang Yi.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.219
(So Song Zhichu planned this long ago.)

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.060
(He arranged someone to replace me.)

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.860
(I was kept in the dark the whole time.)

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.739
So you're Madam Song.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.500
You must be joking.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.859
Before this,

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.020
your wedding with Chief Song
caused a stir across the city.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.619
A wedding turned into a funeral.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.620
Not something worth mentioning.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.179
Mr. Lin, you're truly fortunate.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.019
Have you been well?

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.779
Thank you for your concern, Madam Song.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.059
Seeing you and Zhichu
living in such harmony,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.739
so loving,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.220
I'm relieved.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.219
I never thought
that one brief meeting at the wedding

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.740
would stay with you.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.179
Your heroic display that day

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.620
has lingered in my mind.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.499
That night,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.779
you really sent Liang Yi
to Lin Yun's bed.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.179
So what?

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.299
Since you're Liang Yi now,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.099
let's see if you've got what it takes

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.220
to keep him in your grasp.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.739
Some brother you are.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.300
You wouldn't even let me marry first.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.260
After you, Chief Song.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.340
Congratulations.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.140
(Ruyi is here too.)

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.419
My foot hurts.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.620
I'm going to change my shoes.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.699
(Ruyi must've been fooled by them too.)

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.140
(I need to tell her the truth.)

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.900
Zhichu.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.660
Do you really have to say this now?

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.180
When are you going to marry me?

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.299
Why are you bringing this up again?

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.139
Didn't I say to wait a bit longer?

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.739
We agreed on this.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.339
You'd take me in
after you married the young lady.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.299
Now that she's gone,

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.859
when do you plan to...

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.379
This is Chengyun Society.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.259
Mind your tongue.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.579
How much longer do you want me to wait?

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.859
If it weren't for me covering for her,

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.819
that fool Lu Man would've
slipped up long ago.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.899
If anything happens to me,

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.139
I promise you,

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.339
the evidence
of you ruining the Liang family

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.740
will spread through the whole city.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.979
How could I not want to marry you?

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.899
It's all because of my father.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.659
Any kind of rumor right now

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.180
would affect his run
for provincial governor this year.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.060
So marrying me would damage
the Song family's reputation?

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.980
Of course I don't think that.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.339
I'm only worried
my father will overthink it.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.259
I betrayed the young lady
who helped me, all for you.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.819
If you dare disappoint me,

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.699
I'll drag you down with me.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.300
Alright, I got it.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.940
Don't talk nonsense.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.260
(So even Ruyi betrayed me.)

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.180
Zhichu.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.499
Where did you go?

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.740
I've been looking for you.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.099
I was just walking around nearby.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.820
Have you two been here this whole time?

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.659
Chief Song, you're our important guest.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.540
We couldn't start without you.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.739
Mrs. Lin's concern
always makes me feel a little...

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.259
too intentional.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.780
That was a misunderstanding.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.499
Mr. Lin said

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.499
you're his closest brother.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.900
I'll have to toast you
a few more times.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.820
After you, Chief Song.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.180
Alright.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.299
The madams really
do share the same taste.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.700
You're even changing
into the exact same shoes.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.219
Today,

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.619
let us all witness

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.699
the sacred wedding
of Mr. Lin Yun and Miss Xu Yin.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.299
Now,

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.899
please welcome our bride and groom

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.620
as they make their grand entrance.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.059
Next,

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.420
the bride and groom will
give their vows.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.780
On this important day,

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.980
I'll make a promise to Miss Xu Yin.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.939
I will not deceive you.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.259
I will not betray you.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.980
I will be the one you trust most.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.460
I hope we can always
be honest with each other

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.580
and grow old side by side.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.139
Today

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.419
is the most important moment of my life.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.379
Here,

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.219
I make this promise to Mr. Lin Yun.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.339
I will not deceive you.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.699
I will not betray you.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.660
I will be the one you trust most.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.420
We will grow old together.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.460
Miss Xu Yin,

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.140
will you marry me?

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.020
(I will protect you forever
like my own sister.)

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.579
I will.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.060
(I'm sorry. I lied to you.)

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.579
Next,

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.059
please welcome the witnesses,

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.579
Rong City Police Chief
Song Zhichu and his wife,

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.859
to offer their blessings
to the newlyweds

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.979
and light the flame of love.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.100
Please.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.859
Today is the happiest day

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.939
of my dearest buddy, Lin Yun.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.299
I'm honored to light this flame of love

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.380
for my brother and sister-in-law.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.699
(Song Zhichu.)

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.540
(This time, you're done for.)

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.180
Watch out!

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.340
(Lin Yun.)

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:12.620
Boss.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.820
Lin Yun!

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.220
Are you alright?

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.100
Are you alright?

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.659
(Lin Yun is way too meticulous.)

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.980
(The moment he investigates
the explosion, he'll suspect me.)

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.660
(I need to come up with a plan.)

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:49.979
Mr. Lin's arm is injured.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.939
Be cautious.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.139
These next few days, Mrs. Lin
must keep a close eye on him.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.780
Make sure the wound doesn't get wet.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.180
I understand.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.980
When you rushed forward just now,
I nearly died of fright.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.139
I was terrified
something would happen to you.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.220
Is Song Zhichu's life really
more important than your own?

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.619
You're still laughing?

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.780
I'm done talking to you.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.939
I know you're worried about me.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.140
Don't worry.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.820
I can handle myself.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.139
Since you're injured,

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.620
I'll let it go this time.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.339
Chief Song and his wife have left.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.579
I personally saw them off.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.339
Also,

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.259
in a trash bin
not far from Chengyun Society,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.820
we found the cake
that was switched out.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.380
It was premeditated.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.579
Boss,

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.460
other than Huaying Brothel,

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.260
have you dealt with anyone recently?

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.259
You think the killer was after me?

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.499
Who else? Inviting Chief Song
and his wife to light the candles

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.180
was something we discussed last minute.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.059
No one could've

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.700
predicted our decision.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.220
Who would use that moment to kill them?

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.459
Did you check the bakery?

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.579
I sent people to ask.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.259
The day after we ordered our cake,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.419
a woman wearing a veil

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.580
ordered the exact same one.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.699
Have you found her?

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.100
Not yet.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.259
Keep looking.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.220
Yes.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.020
Where did you go this morning?

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.780
You showered
with the bathroom window open.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.100
Nothing eludes your sharp eyes.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.300
It's because of this.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.459
Your wedding gift.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.820
Do you like it?

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.579
I actually had it ready last night.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.899
But the shopkeeper said
he needed time to engrave it,

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.219
so I had to
sneak out this morning to pick it up.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.699
I wanted to surprise you,

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.300
but you still found out.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:27.579
I'm thirsty.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.819
Pour me a glass of water.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:29.900
Alright.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.500
Do you remember the first time
your father beat you?

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.180
Why bring that up all of a sudden?

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.259
It just feels like
after seeing you again,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.540
you're very different
from how you were back then.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.140
People grow up.
Of course things change.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.700
Do you remember
how you used to cling to me every day?

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.339
Your father locked you up
just to scare you,

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:05.939
but

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.580
he never expected
you'd climb out through the window.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.860
I found you in the abandoned temple
behind the mountain.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.819
You were crying your heart out.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.139
After that,

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.180
your father never dared scare you again.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.539
He told me he was afraid
you'd run away again

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.060
and bad things might happen.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.219
All of a sudden,

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.740
I really miss my dad.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.259
Get the file

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.620
from the drawer.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.220
Alright.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.260
Do you remember why you cried that day?

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.779
What else could it be?

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.300
I was scared, obviously.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.459
That year,

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.980
you ran away
and hid in that mountain temple.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.660
When I found you,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.660
you were terrified.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.300
You clung to me and cried nonstop.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.500
Remember?

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.979
Of course I remember.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.819
I was alone all night.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.380
I was scared to death.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.220
You lured me to Huaying Brothel
on purpose, didn't you?

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.660
Who are you really?

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.299
Just now,

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.179
didn't you swear at the wedding

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.179
that I was the one you loved most?

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.940
And now you're doubting me?

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.899
That table
was painted just two days ago.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.820
The paint underneath isn't even dry.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.899
You touched it with your bare hand,

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.980
and nothing happened to you.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.020
Back then,

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.059
when the temple was being repainted,

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.700
Xu Yin cried because
she was allergic to the paint.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.139
You're full of schemes,

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.260
and you won't even spare
the one you love most.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.700
The one I love most?

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.460
You? Don't make me laugh.
