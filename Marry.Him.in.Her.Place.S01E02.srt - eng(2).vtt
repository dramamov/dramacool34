=Episode 2=

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.539
(By now,)

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.779
(I've understood)

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.900
(that the Liang Yi
I used to be is gone.)

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.500
(This face is the only
bargaining chip fate left me.)

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.459
(To: Lin Yun)
(After Xiao Mudan left,)

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.099
(I found Xu Yin's final letter
by accident.)

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.739
(From: Xu Yin)
(Turns out she was Lin Yun's fiancée.)

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.600
(The very man I was thrown to
on my wedding night,)

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.900
(treated like some toy by Song Zhichu.)

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.859
(Xu Yin and Lin Yun were separated
years ago and never reunited.)

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.700
(This dragon jade pendant
was the token he gave her.)

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.419
(I pretended to play along
with Xiao Mudan)

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.994
(and had her plaster posters of me)

00:01:52.995 --> 00:01:54.480
(Huaying Brothel)
(wearing the pendant everywhere.)

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.620
(I was betting everything.)

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.260
(Maybe Lin Yun would be
my one chance to survive.)

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.380
Stop the car!

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.780
Find out

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.900
who that woman is

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.699
and where her necklace came from.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.259
(Huaying Brothel)

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.500
(Libation)

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.219
(When Lin Yun)

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.539
(showed up tonight,)

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.219
(I knew)

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.020
(my gamble paid off.)

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.540
Who are you?

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.019
Lin Yun,

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.020
it's me, Xu Yin.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.940
Did you do this?

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.539
Mr. Lin,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.499
you may be notorious in Rong City,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.819
but I'm no pushover either.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.180
You dare come at us?

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.860
You like burying people alive.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.580
Allow me to fulfill your wish.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.179
Seal the coffin.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.180
Let me out!

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.180
I'll do it.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.859
Mr. Lin, spare me!

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.220
Please, let me go!

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.500
I'll never do it again, Mr. Lin!

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.100
I swear! Please let me out!

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.620
(Libation)

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.299
These are everyone's contracts.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.700
Starting today,

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.420
Huaying Brothel belongs
to Chengyun Society.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.979
From now on,
Xu Yin calls the shots here.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.059
If anyone steps out of line,

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.980
Chengyun Society won't hesitate

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.260
to strike you down.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.579
Xu Yin, please let us go.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.260
We were forced into doing this.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.180
Row your own boat

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.939
if you want to cross the sea.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.900
From this day forth,

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.260
the only people who can save you

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.340
are yourselves.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.339
Didn't you say
I'm the boss of Huaying Brothel now?

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.499
You're the man in charge.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.980
Don't go back on your word.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.179
(You told me in bed)

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.340
(that there isn't a single good man
in this world.)

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.779
(I'll show you)

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.340
(there aren't any women
you can walk over either.)

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.460
You think a necklace could fool me?

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.179
Do you have any idea

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.300
what happens to someone

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.260
who pretends to be my woman?

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.540
I spent all that time in Huaying Brothel

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.020
waiting for you to show up.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.899
When I refused clients,

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.100
Xiao Mudan tortured me.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.260
My birthmark's barely visible now.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.980
If you don't believe me,

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.979
kill me right here.

We've looked into it.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.139
She is Mr. Xu's daughter.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.579
She tried to drown herself
over three months ago

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.419
and was brought back
to the brothel by Xiao Mudan.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.540
(Liu Xiu,
Second-in-command of Chengyun Society)

(will give me the chance
I need for revenge.)

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.860
Lin Yun.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.619
You must be Xu Yin,

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.820
the woman Lin Yun saved
from Huaying Brothel?

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.580
Chief Song.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.299
I know you.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.220
You're Lin Yun's best friend.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.419
Your eyes remind me

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.540
of someone.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.019
What a coincidence.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.180
You remind me of someone too.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.979
Lin Yun,

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.940
he tried to take advantage of me.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.100
Zhichu,

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.540
she's my woman.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.020
She's your sister-in-law.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.740
Get to know her.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.060
I heard you came out of Huaying Brothel.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.620
Seeing you today
proves the stories were true.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.020
Good friends should share.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.620
You can have anything from me,

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.020
except her.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.500
She's mine.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.460
Oh.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.899
I made you some soup.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.020
Try it.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.179
Leave it here.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.940
Okay.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.140
You walk in without knocking now?

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.900
What's the matter?

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.499
No outsiders here. Say it.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.540
We'll talk outside.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.740
I'll leave you two to talk. Excuse me.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.379
Why are you acting so jumpy?

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.019
What? Since when do I need to knock
before entering your room?

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.960
You get yourself a woman,
and forget your friends.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.819
I'm an outsider now?

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.219
I'm not welcome anymore?

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:47.899
Should I start…

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.340
What's your problem?

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:52.899
About the engagement,

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.780
are you sure you've thought it through?

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.139
I gave Mr. Xu my word before he died.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.899
I know you owe him your life,

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.619
but…

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.059
She's been…

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.420
What are you implying?

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:04.900
She's tainted.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.499
Say it again.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.379
I'll say it ten times.
It doesn't change the truth.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.779
If you want to repay your debt, fine,

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.099
just keep her in your home
and take care of her.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.219
But marriage?

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.540
I won't agree.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.180
Why would I need your approval
to get married?

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.300
It's not just you now.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.400
You've got the entire Chengyun Society
depending on you.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.379
You want the whole city laughing at us?

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.339
Did you forget the reason
we clawed our way up from nothing?

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.540
Liu Xiu!

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.699
(Mr. Xu,)

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.979
(I've avenged Xu Yin for her.)

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.219
(You may rest in peace now.)

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.317
(Memorial tablet of Xu Gonghan)
(Taking her place)

00:12:02.318 --> 00:12:04.259
(Offered by Lin Yun)
(was never my intention.)

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.539
(But Song Zhichu left me no choice.)

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.859
(I have to avenge my father.)

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.700
(I hope you can forgive me.)

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.580
Father,

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.939
Lin Yun saved me from Huaying Brothel.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.219
His name carries weight now.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.899
Please watch over him.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.179
He can protect me for a lifetime,

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.339
but I don't deserve him
for his whole life.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.219
With who I am now,

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.700
I'll only cause him trouble.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.900
Father,

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.419
once I'm healed,

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.260
I'll take you back to our home.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.820
It'll be just the two of us.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.460
Who said you could leave?

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.140
I'll keep the promise I made to Mr. Xu.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.140
But I'll only bring trouble to you.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.059
No one in Rong City will dare touch you.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.540
Because I said so.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.540
I'll protect you, always.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.620
