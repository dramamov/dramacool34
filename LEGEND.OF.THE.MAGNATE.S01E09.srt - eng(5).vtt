You're here.

Please sit down.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.600
I am the eldest son of the Kang family,
Kang Suyuan.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.150
Nice to see you all.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.700
[Kindhearted and Serene]

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.280
The fact that you've come today

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.280
to help the Kang family out of this crisis

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.560
is a great kindness.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.110
I won't thank each of you individually.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.180
Over the years,

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:36.650
the Kang family's business

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.050
has been smooth sailing,

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.079
which made us arrogant enough

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.630
to take on anything.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.980
This time, we accepted a court assignment

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.680
to transport military supplies.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.810
We thought we could make a good profit,

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.800
but inexplicably,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.130
a sudden fire burned everything to ashes.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.590
My father, in his distress,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.740
coughed up blood and died.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.200
I'm here in mourning clothes
to auction off our family property.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.530
What a disgrace of a son.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.110
But the country is at war,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.810
and people are dying by the thousands.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.150
If the military supplies problem
isn't solved,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.030
who knows how many more

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.890
widows and orphans there will be.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.100
What are my troubles compared with that?

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.030
So I invited you all here today

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.520
to bid together.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.750
[Kindhearted and Serene]

stretching from Shanxi to Shaanxi

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.930
and down to Sichuan.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.560
There are about 40,000 mu
of good farmland,

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.690
217 shops,

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.400

If anyone has doubts,

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.520
please come forward and take a look.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.010
With so much property,

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.190
wouldn't it be better
to borrow money instead?

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.560
Would the Eight Families

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.290
really stand by and do nothing?

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.410
Madam.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.120
Allow me to speak.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.860
Actually,

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.450
these assets

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.120
came from my ancestor,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.580
who failed in his studies,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.280
switched to learning a craft

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.410
and failed again,

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.870
and later found

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.120
a petty clerk's job in the army camp,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.920
earning only a few maces a month.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.190
Later,

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.390
he was put in charge of transporting goods

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.190
for the army

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.870
and met many heroes

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.390
from all over the country.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.480
My great-grandfather
was generous, righteous,

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.630
and a man of his word.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.650
Though he was physically weak,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.330
everyone respected him
as a true man of honor.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.080
Later, several friends

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.120
pooled money
to open an escort agency for him,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.580
and that's when
he suddenly became wealthy.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.010
As the old saying goes,

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.190
"a gentleman's fortune
lasts only three generations."

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.120
Today marks the third generation.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.600
Although the Eight Families
take care of each other,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.310
my great-grandfather once vowed that

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.110
he would never burden his peers.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.560
So today,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.240
I ask friends from all over to make way.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.830
Even if the Kangs
can't do business anymore,

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.470
we must not lose our dignity.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.280
That's all I have to say.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:12.960
Please place your bids.

Whoever can buy the Kang family

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.150
will be quite something.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.240
So how will

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.310
the Eight Families rank from now on?

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.680
Who knows?

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.380
Eleven million taels!

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.690
Why aren't you bidding?

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.400
I don't want the hassle.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.720
Our family already has so many shops

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.650
that we can barely manage them all.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.430
You have no idea.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.290
The more money, the more trouble.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.110
That's a clever way to put it.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.830
If I were truly clever,

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.159

enjoy your meal.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.200
The auction won't end

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.800
until this banquet is over.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.010
Ms. Su,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.000
why aren't you competing with them?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.130
My money doesn't grow on trees.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.430
Who wants to compete with them like that?

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.090
So you can't

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.190
win the property.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.820
Must it be about money?

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.950
He's quite foolish.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:31.680
There are

lots of things in this world

more valuable than money.

You'll see soon enough.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.000
More valuable things?

There are things

to make absolutely sure

I secure the Kang family's property.

Could you let me take it?

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:24.720
No.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.580
I think

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:33.240
someone is trying
to force the Eight Families to death,

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.770
wanting to take everything

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.340
without paying a coin.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.480
Was it done by people from the underworld?

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.410
I don't think so.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.410
They don't have

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.320
that kind of power.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.720
We should stay put

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:49.330
and let the culprit show themselves.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.090
Dead people!

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:54.870
There really are dead people!

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.330
Make up your mind already!

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:58.150
Everyone!

00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:58.870
Everyone!

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.240
Today I'm selling
the Kang family's assets.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.170
I truly don't know why people died.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.680
We're not doing a deal

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.000
where we die!

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:08.160
Let's go!

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.630
Let's go!

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.320
Every-

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.510
Get back!

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.200
-Sit down!
-Sit down!

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.840
By His Highness's order,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.920
no one drinking here today

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.050
is allowed to leave!

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.510
If the Kang family's property isn't sold

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.320
and the military supplies
can't be delivered,

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.780
you can all prepare to die!

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.680
Sit down, all of you!

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.170
Continue the bidding!

00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.950
Seven million taels.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.330
[Kindhearted and Serene]

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.150
Manager Li,

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.000
since they're all dead,

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.670
I'll follow your bid.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:06.670
Okay.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.260
Alright, alright.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.630
Alright.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.600
Clever.

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:18.990
Eight million taels.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.100
Ten million taels.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.960
Young man,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.200
you look unfamiliar.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.870
As long as you know it, that's enough.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:32.470
It's not unfamiliar, right?

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.860
Eleven million taels!

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.270
Everyone, I'll place a bid too.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:40.870
I'd like to see

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.330
if I will get killed today.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.400
Fourteen million taels!

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:52.360
Fifteen million taels!

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.130
No matter what you bid,

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.130
I'll always add another million.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.480
Everyone, forgive me.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.120
I must win today.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:06.050
Hurry up!

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.160
Any more bids?

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.380
Twenty million taels!

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:17.120
What?

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.360
Is Li Baiwan's family in the capital

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.760
not eligible?

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.830
You're joining too, aren't you?

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.320
Yes.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.450
Quite lively here.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.790
But you're not go to do this...

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.120
to me and Mr. Gu, are you?

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:43.440
What are you trying to do?

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.960
I'm thinking the same as you.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.620
I want to snatch this bargain.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.040
Didn't you say you'd help me?

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.390
Come on.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.210
What was your bid again?

00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.320
Twenty million taels.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:12:59.870
Twenty...

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.070
Twenty-one million!

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:05.890
Twenty-five million!

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.670
Twenty-six million!

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.870
Even if you boiled Wang Tiangui's bones
into oil,

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.730
you couldn't get that much money.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:15.550
I have it in my draft bank.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:17.970
I'll lend it to him.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.480
I'm doing this for your father.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.790
Why are you interfering?

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:22.630
Spending 26 million

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:23.820
can make you happy?

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.040
Do you know what I want most?

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.280
I want to see you and my father

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.060
defeated just once.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.270
Childish.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:48.560
Mr. Gu, right?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.260
Please come over here.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:52.840
Everyone,

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.840
if there are no objections,

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.660
the Kang family's property...

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.300
now belongs to Taiyufeng.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:07.350
Manager Kang,

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.480
26 million taels is a large sum.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:12.120
Please allow me
to settle it within 10 days.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:12.720
Thank you.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.840
With so much money,

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:18.830
why did you kill them?

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.510
Madam, what are you thinking?

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:21.610
I didn't kill them.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:22.750
Good.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:24.030
From now on, Taiyufeng

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.960
will be part of the Eight Families.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.690
Congratulations, Mr. Gu.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.180
Congratulations.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.300
His Highness has arrived!

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.480
Why is His Highness here?

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:49.770
Your Highness.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.840
The rebels are running rampant,

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.000
[Prince Shen]

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.510
and the imperial court
is pressing urgently.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.110
Without money and supplies,

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.840
the army can't be sustained.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.770
You can't afford to take the blame.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.720
I am selling off my family property.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.360
Within 10 days,

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.290
I'll repay the military supplies.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:12.840
Ten days?

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.120
Is this what the Eight Families do?

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.480
The country is in crisis,

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.440
yet you're all here haggling.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.650
The imperial court says I'm

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:26.820
too soft-hearted.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.370
Well, I have no choice now.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.840
Lock them all up.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.480
At least I'll have something to report.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.070
Yes!

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:34.980
Take them away!

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:40.750
If you don't pay within 3 days...

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:41.260
-Go!
-Go!

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.660
None of you will survive.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.250
Hurry up!

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:44.690
Move!

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.120
Hurry!

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.180
Move it!

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:46.640
Move!

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.390
Move!

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:47.910
Go!

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.390
Move!

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:49.720
Go!

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:53.570
You think having a bit of money

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.340
makes you humans?

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.360
To me,

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.170
you're nothing.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.120
Move!

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:02.600
Hurry!

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.600
Move!

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:05.670
Hurry!

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:13.240
Well?

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:15.050
Your brother's head

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.740
will fall faster than his hat.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:22.600
Gu...

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.460
It's gone sour.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.859
Stop drinking—it's spoiled.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.839
Sour or not, it's still food.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:19.720
Mr. Gu,

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.200
tell them

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.400
you're not one of the Eight Families.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.000
You don't need to suffer here.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.750
I told them,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.200
but they wouldn't listen.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:27.750
They think

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.480
since I bought the Kang family's property,

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.340
I'm one of the Eight Families now.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.480
Let's face this hardship together.

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.160
I'm afraid by tomorrow,

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.720
even this spoiled porridge will be gone.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.920
Would you like a bowl?

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.510
[Wanyuandang]

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.070
I came to take over Shanxi.

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:49.240
With the way they run things—

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.300
small operations, small ambitions—

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.560
they can't keep their footing.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:54.510
Before I came,

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:55.640
I told His Highness.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:59.070
I'm opening a draft bank right here.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.480
I've already thought of the name.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.640
It will be called Taiping Bank.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.640
From Pingyao,

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.900
it will spread to all the nearby counties

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.720
and eventually across
the entire Qing Empire.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.810
Taiping Bank will be a big pouch,

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.240
swallowing every draft bank

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.350
in Pingyao.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.680
It's a fine business.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:19.320
The Li family in the capital

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.640
will take over the draft bank business.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.550
Three million taels in ransom
for each family?

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:26.550
Isn't that bleeding the locals dry?

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:28.960
How could he even come up with that?

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.150
The imperial court
has been asking us for money

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.550
quite a lot over the past few years.

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:33.030
Have they won any battles?

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.000
Just wait till I get out.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.400
I have connections with a few people

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.600
in the Grand Council.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.350
I'll buy myself an imperial censor
and impeach him!

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.880
Mr. Sun, don't be angry.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.920
In this situation,

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.510
without paying, none of us is getting out.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:46.350
How will you ever get the chance

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:47.270
to buy yourself an imperial censor

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.200
and impeach him?

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:49.970
He's the famous

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.240
Prince of the Iron Helmet.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.970
His words can shake mountains.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.820
You think you can impeach him?

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:56.410
You've got a point.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.650
I'm just curious about one thing.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:00.630
At the Jinyang Villa gathering,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.270
all the people we invited

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.030
are from the major banks in Shanxi.

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:05.630
How did they know so clearly?

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.880
They blocked the door

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.210
and arrested everyone.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.590
I don't think

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.840
this is as simple as it looks.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:20.720
Father,

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:21.830
you're here.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:28.680
Well now.

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:30.790
It all depends on you now.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.000
You two talk.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.640
Why are you always hanging around

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.880
with that exile?

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.160
You already know what we've been doing?

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.310
We created a storefront pawning

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.910
and a door-to-door pawning.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.680
We've turned Pingyao

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.590
upside down.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.960
It was truly satisfying.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.160
You may be satisfied,

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.110
but who will take the blame for harboring

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.680
an exile?

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.240
That won't fall on you.

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:57.000
Don't worry.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.370
Just tell me,

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.510
why did you really come here?

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.880
I sincerely apologize

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.700
for the inconvenience.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.070
His Highness asked me to check

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.680
whether you ate well.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.680
You are all his guests.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:28.200
If there's anything lacking

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.800
lacking in our hospitality,

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.510
please forgive us.

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.790
Your prince is too kind.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:39.350
I don't have

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.610
3 million taels.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.690
All my money is invested in tea.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:45.240
Go confiscate my household

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.640
with an imperial decree.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:47.830
I'm not qualified

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:48.880
to be His Highness's guest.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.480
I don't have that much money.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.940
About this matter,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.130
we've already spoken to His Highness.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:55.930
However,

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.870
His Highness has a noble status.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:59.290
If he takes back

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:00.640
what he said,

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.440
he'll lose face, won't he?

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.160
The money in our draft banks

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.790
belongs to the people of Shanxi.

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:07.190
If it's all taken at once,

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.870
how will the people survive?

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
The imperial court

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.400
has already lost Jiangnan.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.400
Now they want Shanxi

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.660
to fall into chaos too?

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.130
Young man,

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.400
you look unfamiliar.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.080
May I know your name?

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:24.350
Everyone in this room

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.350
has only one name—

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:27.110
Silver.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.270
Nickname: Ingot.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.040
That's right.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:31.510
Sir,

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.000
stop pretending to be polite.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.160
State your terms.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:36.790
Fine.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.000
This time, His Highness brought

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:41.770
a draft bank from the capital,

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.790
planning to station it in Shanxi

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:46.230
to manage the army's grain and funds.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.160
If you can't raise

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.620
the 3 million taels,

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.200
that draft bank can pay on your behalf.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.880
You just need to sign
and stamp your names.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:58.870
As for

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.480
when you repay it,

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.120
you may discuss that among yourselves.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:06.230
Robbers.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:07.350
Strange things happen every year,

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.790
but this year is overflowing with them.

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:10.520
Pingyao now has a Wanyuandang,

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:11.480
said to be owned

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.750
by the son of Li Baiwan from the capital.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.030
And now there's another big draft bank.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:18.480
Our Eight Families

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.030
need a total of 24 million taels,

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:20.830
and they do in fact have it.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:22.680
How can they be so rich?

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.070
Could it be

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.530
the God of Wealth himself has arrived?

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:29.350
Madam Jin,

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.790
this draft bank

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.160
belongs to Mr. Li, Li Wantang.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:35.970
It's called Taiping Bank.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.820
If you all accept this account

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.490
and are willing to sign,

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.020
I guarantee

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.060
you'll be released

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:45.400
immediately.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.510
This Li Baiwan

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:53.960
is too ruthless.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:56.890
Just to establish himself in Shanxi,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:57.830
there's no need

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.570
to ruin all of us.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.000
What is this?

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.910
Using officials to pressure us?

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:07.090
Since that's the case,

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:08.640
you can

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.860
keep drinking your porridge!

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:23.790
Father,

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.810
is this really okay?

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.770
You...

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.790
Just be good.

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:31.990
Don't cause trouble.

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:33.720
As long as you can watch and learn

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.650
from a distance,

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.640
that's all I ask.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:37.860
Father,

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.000
I believe businessmen

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:40.960
should keep their word.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.960
What you're doing

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.440
is robbery,

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:44.640
bullying with power,

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.480
kicking people when they're down—

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.010
using any means necessary.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:18.570
My good son,

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.480
I think you

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.350
should just go back, study hard,

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.260
and try to earn an official title.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.680
Be a good person?

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:35.030
[Loan Ledger of Taiyufeng,
Eighth Year of the Xianfeng Reign]

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:37.480
How much silver did His Highness get

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.480
from Taiping Bank that made him

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:41.720
pull off this stunt?

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.860
No one really knows, I think.

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:47.700
I just feel that

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.200
you've barely joined the Eight Families,

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.400
and already encountered such trouble.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:03.750
It's fake.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.920
Fake? What's fake?

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.390
Which businessman

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.000
would keep all their money

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.040
in one place?

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:14.480
Besides,

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:16.870
which draft bank

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:18.270
could even come up with

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:21.110
3 million taels in cash?

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:25.270
I think the demand for silver
is just a pretext.

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:26.880
Taiping Bank wants to

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.480
take over all the business

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:29.920
of our draft banks

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.560
for themselves.

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.310
That's their real goal.

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:36.720
Once these wealthy families
of the Eight Families

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.310
sign the loan,

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:40.160
they'll be as good as

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:42.830
meat on someone's board.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:45.350
This Li Baiwan...

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.850
is quite cunning.

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:13.400
Is His Highness coming?

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.090
I don't know.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:19.880
Everyone,

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.400
please forgive me.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.000
I had no choice

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:25.220
but to meet you in prison.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.250
Li Wantang?

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:30.590
Mr. Li,

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.070
are you here to mock us?

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:33.200
I wouldn't dare.

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:37.040
We're all in the same line of trade.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.680
I just came to see

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:40.170
if I could be of any help.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.510
You could.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.480
Hurry and tell His Highness

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.640
to release us.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:48.590
We didn't kill anyone
or set fire to anything.

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:49.590
Keeping us here?

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:51.590
How undignified.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.030
Since ancient times,
officials have had two mouths—

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:58.490
the words from the two mouths
are different.

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:00.440
Reasoning with them doesn't work.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.350
I can pay the 24 million taels first

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:04.420
to help you

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.110
escape this disaster.

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:08.590
What do you think?

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:10.910
What a show of power.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.530
The whole Qing Empire

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.380
only makes this much in a year.

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.130
What exactly are you trying to do?

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.870
Times are tough, Madam.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:26.930
Those of us in business

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.210
need to work together even more.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:30.680
I've been in the capital

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.810
for too long, rarely visiting Shanxi,

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:34.270
but I still have

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.640
some influential connections

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.200
at the imperial court.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:40.830
Consider this 3 million taels

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:43.920
as my entry into the Eight Families.

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:45.550
If you have any obstacles

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:47.280
to overcome,

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.210
Taiping Bank

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:50.790
will help smooth them over.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:53.790
I'm not trying to take over

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:54.960
the Eight Families.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.260
It's out of respect for your predecessors,

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.720
offering my humble assistance.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.350
That's a bit much.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.130
That's not the right way to see it.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.510
Fine.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:18.720
If you don't agree,

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:21.350
I'll just return to the capital.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.070
Fine.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:23.270
Fine.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.030
But the military situation is urgent,

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.400
and His Highness has a fiery temper.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:31.440
When I came, he said,

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.200
"The Eight Families"

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.490
"hold King Li's Treasure."

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.720
"Why won't they let go of
a little profits?"

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:42.750
"It's infuriating."

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.790
King Li's Treasure?

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.480
Every child in Shanxi

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.510
grows up knowing this story,

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:48.110
right?

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:48.790
Yes.

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:50.640
You actually believe that?

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:53.270
Weren't you here

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:54.800
for King Li's Treasure too?

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:59.560
Back then,
King Li's army was incredibly fierce.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.480
They came out of the Qinling Mountains,

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.160
passed through the Taihang Mountains,

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.820
broke through Tongguan Pass,
flooded Kaifeng,

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.890
swept across the Yellow River,

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:09.960
and conquered the Central Plains.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:10.480
But what happened

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.210
after they got all that wealth?

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:15.310
The generals indulged in pleasure,

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:16.590
the soldiers feared death,

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:17.670
and in the end

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.480
they came to a mysterious downfall.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.540
What was it all for?

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.540
That's truly a terrible omen.

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:27.000
Those words are really insightful.

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:33.750
You're... Gu Pingyuan?

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:40.920
Yes.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.400
My son mentions you often.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:52.550
Your words show great insight.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.440
However,

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:56.970
that's a scholar's perspective.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.510
If you want to go into business
in the future,

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:01.680
that would be a big mistake.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.280
What mistake?

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:08.270
Gold and silver

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.590
are public tools of the world.

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:13.310
They carry no inherent good or evil.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.050
People are responsible

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.570
for their own mistakes.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.440
Blaming money itself

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:19.750
makes no sense.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:24.660
There is no money that cannot be used,

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:28.720
no person that cannot be employed.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.270
Remember that.

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:15.640
I, Li Wantang,
pay respects to Your Highness.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:18.000
Your plan didn't work.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.460
The imperial court

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:46.270
ordered me to go to Shandong
to suppress the rebellion,

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:48.020
but I keep delaying my advance.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.540
If I hold up
the imperial court's important matters,

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:51.670
who takes the blame,

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:53.270
you or me?

00:31:57.030 --> 00:31:57.980
Your Highness.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.900
These merchants are extremely cunning.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:03.870
If we don't wait long enough,

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.510
this won't succeed.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.580
Each of them

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.920
is well-connected
with powerful officials at court.

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.560
If they find a censor

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:16.200
and report me for bleeding the locals dry,

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.880
I won't be able to handle it.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.740
Your Highness.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.160
I'm a businessman.

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:25.070
I understand businessmen best.

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:26.720
These wealthy people

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.720
may look generous from the outside,

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.150
but deep down,

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.650
every single one of them is stingy.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:35.030
Their money
is practically glued to their ribs.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:37.000
When you really ask them to hand it over,

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
you'd need a pair of pliers
to pull it out,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.400
with the strength

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.060
of ripping out their tendons.

00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:44.440
Three million taels

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.000
won't come that easily.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.070
If you don't push them

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:56.220
to the brink,

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:58.960
you'll never get what you want.

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:02.880
Does...

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:10.630
King Li's Treasure really exist

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.200
in this world?

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:22.710
Your Highness, look.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:24.790
Pingyao and Taigu

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:28.860
are the birthplace of Shanxi's wealth.

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:30.110
In terms of transportation,

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:32.000
this region is surrounded by mountains.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.920
As for resources,
there are no gold or silver mines.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:36.200
As for talents,

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.260
the people here are honest and plain,

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:41.000
with no long tradition of doing business.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.720
Yet right after the Ming dynasty fell,

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.830
these two places suddenly became rich.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:48.830
Now look here.

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:52.140
This is Taihang Mountains.

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:53.920
King Li fled along this route,

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.050
spreading out from here to both sides.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:58.210
I'm certain...

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:01.220
the treasure

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.030
exists,

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:04.590
and

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.880
hasn't been much depleted.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.900
As for the so‑called Eight Families,

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.360
they've been in business

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.320
for generations.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.600
Business has its profits and losses.

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.510
How have they stayed prosperous

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.150
for over a hundred years?

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.820
Where did their capital come from?

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:28.800
How could this be possible?

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:32.320
Li Wantang,

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:34.960
Li Baiwan.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.000
You'd better

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:38.060
not be wrong.

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.030
I burned the military supplies,

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.280
and that was your idea.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.360
If I delay the military operations,

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.820
fail to find the treasure,

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:50.600
and lose the military supplies
on top of that,

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.610
then I'll have no choice

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.820
but to use your head

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.699
to make up for the loss.

00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:59.830
Your Highness, don't worry.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:00.550
Trust me.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.070
By then,

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.290
the treasure will be yours,

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.690
and Shanxi will be mine.

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:09.000
As long as you understand what's at stake.

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:10.540
Within 3 days,

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:13.170
make up the money
for the military supplies.

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:14.280
No matter what,

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.370
I have to cross the Yellow River
into Shandong

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:19.520
and fight this battle.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.440
Kang,

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:42.120
how could you be so careless

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:43.070
as to let

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:44.850
the military supplies

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:45.670
get burned?

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.610
You think I wanted them burned?

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.920
I never wanted to take the deal
in the first place.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:50.800
The local officials

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:51.800
forced me to do it.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:52.760
The fire

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:54.690
must have been set by them.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.730
Putting everything together,

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:00.960
this might be a chain of traps.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.070
They burned
His Highness's military supplies,

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:04.960
forced the Kang family
to sell their property,

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:05.590
then

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:08.150
arrested everyone—

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:11.390
step by step
leading to the situation we're in now.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.830
Even if every one of you

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:13.630
could bring out

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:14.960
3 million taels in cash,

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.070
they would still

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:17.200
keep squeezing you.

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:19.410
Because what they truly want

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.260
is King Li's Treasure.

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:35.550
Why do people in this world

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:36.960
love to talk nonsense?

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.550
As the saying goes,

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:46.320
"a gentleman's only crime
is to carry a jade."

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.590
Whether we admit it or not,

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:48.960
as long as they believe we have it,

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.840
we're guilty.

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:51.960
I'm thinking

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:53.830
that this stalemate can't go on.

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.940
We should talk to His Highness

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.440
and have both sides take a step back.

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:05.860
Such childish talk.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.510
Why would he take a step back?

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:10.400
To the government,

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:12.600
we're nothing but ants.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.760
If they find out

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:17.440
we don't have

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:18.900
King Li's Treasure at all,

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:23.330
we probably won't even get
this spoiled porridge anymore.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:24.670
That makes sense.

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:32.320
Do you

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.670
really have

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:34.920
3 million taels in cash

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.030
on hand right now?

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:38.150
We already said we don't.

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:41.190
The money in the draft banks
belongs to the depositors.

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:42.170
Our own capital

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:43.770
is all tied up in goods.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000
You don't have it.

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:47.150
Even if you don't, we can't just

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:48.360
sit here and let them push us to death,

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:48.760
right?

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:52.010
Then tell us,

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.440
what should we do?

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:55.640
I've been thinking—

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.640
no matter how wealthy Li Wantang is,

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:58.940
at the end of the day

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:00.510
he's a merchant just like us.

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:01.770
Everything he's doing

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.670
is simply

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:04.840
to seize control of all the draft banks

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:05.840
in Shanxi.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.160
Here's what we can do.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:10.690
First, we give His Highness an IOU,

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.760
pretending we're willing
to take on this debt

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.290
and will deliver the silver

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.660
on the date he sets. His

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:17.690
His Highness

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:19.040
isn't a local official.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.410
He could be called to war at any moment.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.230
24 million taels of silver

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.190
can't be spent

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:25.230
in just one night.

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:27.360
As long as he gives us some time

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.280
to maneuver,

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:29.570
we can turn around

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:30.320
and go all out

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:31.440
against Li Wantang

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:34.160
and force him out of Shanxi.

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:35.230
I believe that

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:36.960
without His Highness backing him,

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:37.710
he wouldn't

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.020
have such great power.

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:40.510
No way.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.230
It's easy for the Eight Families
to accept the debt,

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:45.940
but Li Wantang isn't a child.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.760
He has plenty of methods.

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:49.330
If he makes this IOU

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:50.320
public

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:52.110
and announces that our draft banks

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:53.770
owe the imperial court money,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:54.930
our credibility

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.550
will be ruined overnight.

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:57.920
The depositors will fear

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.030
we're using their money

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:01.230
to fill the imperial court's
bottomless pit.

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:02.430
If there's a bank run,

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.220
how could we handle it?

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.190
Who says business

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:08.990
must be done with actual silver?

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:15.110
Bro,

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.110
you've had too much spoiled porridge.

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:18.370
Your brain's gone off.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.070
Madam.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.760
Right now none of us
has a single coin on hand.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.630
But I want to make a business deal

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:27.920
of 100 thousand taels with you.

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:28.920
Is that possible?

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:32.110
For example,

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:33.390
this bowl in your hand

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:34.590
is worth 100 thousand taels.

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:35.190
I want it.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.190
But all my money

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:38.480
is deposited with Manager Sun.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.410
What should I do?

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.090
Manager Sun,

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.880
please give me 100 thousand taels.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.210
I don't have any silver.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.030
And even if I did, carrying it around

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:48.150
would be troublesome.

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:50.150
Your jade pendant looks quite nice.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.120
Could you give it to me as a token?

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:54.800
That's easy.

00:39:58.960 --> 00:39:59.650
Madam,

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:01.080
Manager Sun said

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:03.030
that as long as you see this token,

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.770
you'll know

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:04.670
that the 100 thousand taels

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:06.150
have already been credited
to your account.

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:07.080
With this token,

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:07.760
may I

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.150
take this bowl now?

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.480
Was this agreed upon before?

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:13.110
When we conduct a real transaction,

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:14.280
we need a contract.

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:15.370
This way,

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.000
the Eight Families can handle

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.960
entries and records
from one account to another

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.320
without using a single tael

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.380
of cash.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.510
If there's a bank run,

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:25.280
the combined strength
of the Eight Families

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.340
will be more than enough to handle it.

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:28.590
And if each family acts alone,

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:30.050
each can use its own credit

00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:31.470
to guarantee the others.

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:33.580
Transaction records must be kept

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:35.280
for year-end accounting.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.190
As long as the business

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.590
stays within the Eight Families,

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:38.530
one written note

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:40.430
can be worth a million in silver.

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:41.840
What do you think of this method?

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.690
But what if...

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:44.760
What if one family

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.960
breaks the rules?

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.440
What if one of them faces a bank run

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:51.490
and the others don't know in time,

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:54.030
and the funds
can't be shifted quickly enough?

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.560
And also,

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:56.610
what if all Eight Families

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.530
face a bank run at the same time?

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:01.360
We can appoint a chief manager

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.400
to check the funds every day

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.660
and publicly announce

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:06.030
an alliance of the Eight Families.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.550
That way, even if a bank run happens,

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:09.210
the impact won't be too great.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.320
Maybe one or two families will suffer,

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.230
but it shouldn't be too hard

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:13.590
to handle.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:14.630
Good.

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:16.440
It's truly good.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:17.400
If we had thought of

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.200
this earlier,

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:19.150
Li Baiwan

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:20.710
would never have gained
a foothold in Shanxi,

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:21.480
and we wouldn't have been

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.340
taken advantage of by outsiders.

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:26.400
So who will take

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.020
this chief manager position?

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:33.990
How about letting me try?

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:37.970
It's just for show anyway,

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:39.480
just to get through

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:41.080
our current difficulties.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.180
That is,

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.400
if you consider me

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.530
one of your own.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.840
We've been eating

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.280
spoiled porridge
from the same pot these past few days.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.740
Of course you're one of us.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:53.280
You're part of the Eight Families now.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.280
I don't think letting him join

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.150
is a bad idea.

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:57.930
Alright.

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:00.150
You'll be the chief manager.

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:01.470
It was your idea.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.400
Show everyone how it's done.

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:05.250
Does anyone have objections?

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:13.330
Alright.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:14.880
In that case,

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.670
I hope by this time tomorrow,

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:18.760
we're no longer eating spoiled porridge.

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:20.360
I'll go negotiate with them.

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:23.510
It's settled.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:25.820
Guards!

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:27.610
I need to see His Highness!

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.440
Send out my order.

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.680
Deploy 20,000 troops

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.280
to Mount Liang area

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:34.790
and tighten the net.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.620
Your Highness.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.670
I would like to report to you on behalf of

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:46.330
the Eight Families of Hedong.

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:48.130
I request a private audience.

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:53.570
A private audience?

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:56.120
You think you deserve that?

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.400
I don't, of course.

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:01.300
But does silver

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:02.760
deserve it?
