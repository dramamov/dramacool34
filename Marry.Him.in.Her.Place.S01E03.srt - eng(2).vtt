Liu, where do you want these?

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.699
To the warehouse.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.499
Stop piling them.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.180
You're turning this place into a dump.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.699
Quit yelling for nothing.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.619
Get to work.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.379
Talk less.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.300
Got it.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.099
Liu Xiu.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.219
These wedding invites still aren't out.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.860
You can't just send wedding invites
whenever you feel like it.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.139
In Chengyun Society,

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.220
they go out only
when the boss gives the word.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.299
You mean,

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.539
you want me to tell people
you're from Huaying Brothel?

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.699
Indeed.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.619
I,

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.099
I'm Lin Yun's bride-to-be
from Chengyun Society.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.019
Why?

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.419
Aren't you worried people will talk?

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.019
That's exactly what I want.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.779
The more they gossip, the better.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.099
Best case,

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.420
the whole city hears about it.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.499
Chengyun Society? More like a brothel gang.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.580
What did you say?

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.419
Lin Yun married a prostitute.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.460
Chengyun Society's just
a brothel gang now.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.060
Exactly.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.740
What're you doing?

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.899
Bad news, Xiu.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.180
The goods caught fire.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.019
Find yourself impressive?

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.020
Is that it?

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.179
You went out brawling
over some trash talk.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.139
And now all the goods are burned.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.740
You turn
Chengyun Society into a laughing stock!

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.420
We're not the ones embarrassing us.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.100
What's that supposed to mean?

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.699
You should've heard
how mean they sounded.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.219
They said you married a prostitute.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.499
That Chengyun Society
might as well be a brothel gang.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.619
We worked so hard to get here.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.939
You can take it, but we can't.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.860
So that's what you think too?

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.979
Yeah, I think that.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.620
But outsiders don't get to say it.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.620
This is how you lead the guys?

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.460
Should Chengyun Society
take your surname then?

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.500
So you refuse to admit fault?

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.260
Then we start with you.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.940
Boss.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.860
No!

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.940
This happened because of me.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.179
I should take the punishment.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.460
Save the fake kindness.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.380
I'm not taking your pity.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.619
I'm from Huaying Brothel.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.900
People will talk behind my back.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.299
That's just the truth.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.939
These brothers speak their minds.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.619
They feel bad for their boss.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.139
But if they get punished for this,

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.260
that'd dishearten everyone.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.779
This punishment

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.620
should be mine.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.380
Do it!

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.900
Do it!

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.899
Wedding or not, that's not important.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.139
We're brothers in Chengyun Society.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.259
We can drink among ourselves.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.979
Have a good time.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.900
That's enough.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.940
What say the others?

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.739
Sister-in-law.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.339
If anyone dares talk nonsense again,
I'll rip his mouth off.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.379
We were wrong.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.819
We were wrong.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.139
Chengyun Society's sister-in-law

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.459
is not a shameful person!

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.180
Not a shameful person!

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.220
I crawled out of the mud
and darkness myself.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.060
Why would I fear a few filthy words?

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.179
Our wedding isn't just happening.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.980
It's going to be grand.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.620
Invite the most honored guests.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.300
I want everyone in Rong City to know

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.140
you're my wife.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.939
With my blood,

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.260
I'll cover up the stain of your past.

You didn't need
to take that beating for them.

They're the brothers who'd die for you.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.220
If they end up
resenting you because of me.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.700
it's not worth it.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.340

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.380
(that everything was worth it?)

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:44.780

you can't just barge in like this.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.260
Get dressed.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:36.900
Oh no.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.300
