00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:01.500
And...

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.020
What's wrong?

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.540
Is she okay?

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:05.300
Come sit down.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.700
Take it easy.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.140
Slowly. Be careful.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.220
Breathe slowly.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.420
Take deep breaths.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:13.300
How do you feel?

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:16.820
Easy now.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:17.580
That's right.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:18.500
Okay.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.380
Slowly. Yes.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:21.700
Good.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.300
Take it easy.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:25.780
Okay.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:26.980
Like this.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.340
Will this work?

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.020
Shouldn't we go to the hospital?

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:31.620
Here.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.060
Okay. Lean back.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.100
Easy now. Yes.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:37.340
Right.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:40.620
She's got

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.540
respiratory alkalosis.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.260
It's a type of altitude sickness.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.260
Put this mask over her face

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.420
and breathe back in the carbon dioxide
she exhale.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:49.860
She'll be fine soon.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.460
Are you feeling better?

00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:59.300
Wait,

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.580
don't just focus on her.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:02.740
You don't look so good either.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.020
I...

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:04.860
Get some rest.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:06.580
Alright.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.820
I'll sleep in the car outside tonight.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.180
If anything comes up, just call me.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.020
Okay.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.380
You should get some rest.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:12.700
Okay.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:13.060
By the way,

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.180
the tea is ready.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:14.860
So is the water.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.140
When you drink,

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.420
take small sips

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.420
more frequently.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:18.740
Okay.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:19.500
Sit down now.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.060
Get some rest.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:20.300
Okay.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:21.620
Thank you.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:22.580
Just call me if you need anything.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.020
No problem.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:23.460
Okay.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.100
Are you okay?

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.020
Tan Siting.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:02.380
Tan Siting?

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.100
Feeling better?

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.340
I'm alright.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:09.140
You?

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:11.420
I'm okay.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:16.700
If

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.060
anything comes up, just call me.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:21.100
Okay.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:21.900
I'll be right outside.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:22.700
Okay.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.100
Good night.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:30.780
Good night.

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.100
I want that one.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:40.860
I want this one.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:41.340
I want that one.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:41.780
I want this.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:42.340
Thank you.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:43.260
I want that one.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:44.580
This.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:45.500
That.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.940
This? You want this one too?

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:47.740
I want that one.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:48.900
No pushing. Everyone gets one.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.060
I want that.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:52.780
Here you go.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:54.900
Ma'am, I want this.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:55.500
Here.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.220
Everyone gets one.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:11:59.940
Everyone got one?

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:00.660
Yes.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:01.940
Do you know how to use these?

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.380
No.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.020
Let me show you.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.620
Use this pen.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.180
And you can draw with it.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:10.660
Right?

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.540
Yes.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.460
Then you pull this, and it disappears.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:17.260
Got it?

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:18.740
Yes.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:19.460
You're awake.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:20.700
Who wants a lollipop?

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:21.820
Me!

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.460
Now I understand

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.060
why my dad

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.580
comes here every year
to do charity work.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.660
When I was dancing
with those kids today,

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.260
it felt completely different

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.020
from performing

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:10.740
on stage.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.100
Very relaxing?

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.980
Here, I dance with my heart.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:28.980
This is nice.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.620
I wish time could just stop right now.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:33.780
Do you love this place?

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.180
The people here live

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.540
such peaceful yet passionate lives.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:46.940
Here.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:48.540
Thank you.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.900
Not sure what flower this is,

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:51.740
but it's beautiful.

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:53.300
This is Velvet.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.780
Isn't velvet a type of fabric?

00:13:59.260 --> 00:13:59.580
Yes.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.380
But it's also a flower.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.180
It's called the Star of Bethlehem.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.100
I first learned about it
from an Italian girl

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.900
during a competition in Switzerland.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.620
She said her hometown
was full of these flowers.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.620
She showed me a photo of herself
standing in a field of them.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:15.980
Look.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.860
This flower is small and delicate,

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.460
with pure white petals

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.620
and a black pearl-like center.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.180
That's its ovary.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.580
It looked beautiful.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.180
But another reason I love it

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.140
is its symbolic meaning.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:32.540
What is it?

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.380
It's called
"the miracle of turning around".

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.940
The miracle of turning around?

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:37.580
Yes.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.340
I think it comes from

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.020
the origin of the Star of Bethlehem.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.660
You see, this flower

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.220
is like a shining star in the darkness.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.100
It brings warmth

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.300
and hope.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:49.460
So, Feng Rui,

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.740
you are my Star of Bethlehem.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:56.780
You know what?

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:58.780
After meeting you,

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:00.620
I feel my life

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:01.740
finally has real meaning.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.140
So you are my Velvet.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.260
I think this is the reason

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.700
fate brought us together.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.580
I'm starting to believe

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.420
that everything that happens in life

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.420
happens for a reason.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.580
Just like now, being with you makes me

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:20.860
feel so calm

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:21.980
and happy.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.460
Let's be together.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:38.990
♪How rare it is in life
to have someone to like?♪

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:45.830
♪How rare it is for liking
to become favor?♪

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:53.150
♪How rare it is for favor
to reunite again?♪

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:59.910
♪How rare it is that it's still you?♪

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.020
In the end,

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.860
she chose to go to France

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.580
to pursue her ballet dreams.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.380
I could never find her again.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.460
Bonjour.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.460
Excuse me.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.500
Does Ms. Tan live here?

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.620
I don't know the person you mentioned.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.900
She has lived in this one before.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.500
And she's a Chinese who dances ballet.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.580
Are you sure you don't know her?

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.700
There are many people
renting houses here.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.740
I cannot remember
who comes and goes every day.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:38.820
I only remember

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.460
a young guy living here before.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:42.620
Alright.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.500
Here's my number.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.700
Can you have her call me

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.020
if you see her?

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:52.300
I don't have her contact information.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:57.020
Most of the people living here...
They live here for a short period

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.340
and they just go away.

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.420
Almost no one remembers who came.

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:03.820
Okay.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.900
I'm sorry, sir.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:05.540
Thanks.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.020
My pleasure.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.420
Found her?

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:25.980
No.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.220
Did you give up?

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.740
Come back once you gave up.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.100
The company needs you.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.140
So you still
haven't been able to forget her?

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:43.780
I already have.

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.700
Maybe I've just grown fond
of the feeling

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.300
of missing her.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.140
It really is a story full of regret.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.460
That chapter of life

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.420
was like a phase.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.060
It was beautiful, yet heartbreaking.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:04.700
Just like this wine.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.180
At first sip,

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.860
it has a tartness,

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.620
then it fills with fruity notes,

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.260
and finally,

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:12.420
the aftertaste

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:13.540
carries

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.660
a distinct violet fragrance.

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.620
The tannins in this wine

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.620
create an impact,

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:21.780
even a slight sting, on the tongue.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.020
But it leaves a very deep impression.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.460
Drinking this wine feels like

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.020
it takes me back to our farm.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:30.980
The domestic vineyards

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.060
can now produce such excellent grapes.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.620
It really surprises me.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:37.660
Mr. Feng,

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.140
I'd like to place an order.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:39.860
Is that possible?

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.020
No problem.

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:41.860
Qi,

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:44.380
draft the contract

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:45.900
and give it to our guests.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:46.580
Okay.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:47.940
Thank you.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:49.540
We should be the ones thanking you.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.300
You shared such fine wine with us

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:53.860
and told us your story.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:55.140
Thank you.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.140
It's just that

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.620
life holds

00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.420
too many regrets.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:11.980
Ms. Jin,

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.340
here is the drafted contract.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.360
[Season's Selection: Red Calyx]
If there are any issues,

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.440
feel free to contact us anytime.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.580
Alright. Thank you.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:19.100
Mr. Feng,

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.980
you haven't finished your story.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.500
She still hasn't come back?

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.420
Whether she returns or not
doesn't matter anymore.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.980
We can't go back to how we were.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:33.260
I believe you will meet again someday.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.580
Such a beautiful love story

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.740
must have a very beautiful ending.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:39.300
Yes.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.300
Good luck.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.140
Okay.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:41.740
Bye.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:42.140
Take care.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:42.940
Good luck. Bye.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:14.640
[Cygne]

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:20.980
I heard that Aoyun from Yunnan

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.060
won the gold medal again

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:24.500
at WSC.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.580
Now many foreign wineries

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.700
are looking to invest in Yunnan.

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:30.540
It's settled then.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:31.740
Excuse me for a moment.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:34.460
Ms. Gao,

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.140
I've heard so much about you.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:38.380
You are Mr. Wang from Huacan.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.180
Nice to meet you.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.900
Just call me Wang.

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.820
You are my senior.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.580
I've been wanting to visit you.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:46.540
It's great

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.220
to see you today.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:49.500
You're being modest.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.580
Ms. Gao,

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.660
your son has a very sharp mind.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:54.340
He shared many of his ideas

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:55.780
and visions for domestic wine with me.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.500
Young people have drive.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:58.380
You're too kind.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.020
Huacan's wine is far ahead

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.060
in the domestic wine scene.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.580
Today, we have the chance

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:04.940
to taste it.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.260
Tianlu Trade has a substantial business.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.980
Why don't you let your son take it over?

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.220
The wine business isn't easy.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.020
Huacan has been at it for ten years,

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.340
and sometimes we still feel lost.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.820
So I'd like to learn more
from you today.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.900
Feng Rui

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:20.980
is strong-willed.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.260
He dares to think and act.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.940
He can produce wine
that represents our people.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.020
I think that in itself is commendable.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.020
Yes.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:37.980
[Cygne]
Hello, everyone.

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.100
Today, at the invitation
of Mr. Feng from Cygne

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.540
and Mr. Wang from Huacan, we're here

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.580
to taste

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.460
their new releases together.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.300
The wine on your left is from Cygne,

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.220
and on your right is from Huacan.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.220
You are all leaders

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.020
in our industry.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.020
We look forward
to your valuable feedback

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.860
after the tasting.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.620
Mom, I miss you.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:06.940
Ha.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:08.100
I miss you too.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.340
I'll be back this weekend.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:10.700
Bye.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:11.420
Give me a kiss.

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.380
Good girl.

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:15.540
Bye.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:16.940
Bye.

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:17.940
Daughters are the best.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:19.420
Ms. Guan,

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.340
your daughter is adorable.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.860
I should've had a daughter too.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.300
Sons are too rowdy.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.580
Keep trying, Ms. Bai.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:27.540
Have a girl.

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:29.300
What if it's another boy?

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:30.940
I can't afford

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:31.940
two boys.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:35.500
Ms. Tan, what do you think?

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:36.420
How's our school?

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:38.340
It's great.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.820
It's my ideal ballet school.

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:43.780
So,

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:44.460
Ms. Tan,

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.260
let me be nosy.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.700
Are you married?

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:50.620
Any kids?

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:53.380
You know it's nosy but you still ask.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.380
Just being curious.
Don't you want to know?

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:57.940
Not yet. I'm single.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.260
No boyfriend either?

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.420
No way. With your qualities?

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.300
I heard

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.820
French men are romantic.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.300
That doesn't make sense.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:15.620
I know.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.900
You must have
too many suitors to choose from.

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.220
It's just that I'm too busy with work.

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.020
Didn't have time
to think about these things.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:25.540
Listen to that.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:29.060
She, an internationally
renowned principal dancer,

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.340
devotes all her time

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:31.460
to her career.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.700
Ms. Tan, impressive.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.500
Stop being nosy. Let's eat.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:39.980
You listened and now you're scolding me.

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:46.660
Both are Pinot Noirs,

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.540
but their styles
are completely different.

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.100
I prefer

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.220
Cygne's Pinot Noir.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.140
I have a different opinion.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.740
Huacan's Pinot Noir

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.340
shows the winemaker's
unique craftsmanship.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.620
The acidity is just right

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.060
to support the whole body,

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.500
making it very smooth to drink.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.660
My vote goes to Huacan.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.740
The aromas at each level are distinct,

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.300
and the palate is more mature.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:10.540
It must have been aged

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.740
in new oak barrels for a long time.

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.580
My vote

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.580
goes to Cygne as well.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.020
So now it's a tie.

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:23.020
Ms. Gao, your vote is crucial.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.860
Pinot Noir is one of

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.380
the most delicate grape varieties
in the world.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.220
When cultivated with care,

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.020
its potential is limitless.

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.620
A true Pinot Noir dry red

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.980
should lead us to explore

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.020
and perceive it,

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.180
perfectly interpreting

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.580
the charm

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.500
of its terroir,

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.580
rather than relying

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.340
on excessive human intervention
during winemaking.

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.020
In this regard,

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.860
I think Huacan's Pinot Noir

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.740
lets me taste what Pinot Noir should be.

00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.660
Clean, elegant,

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:01.260
and unpredictable.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:03.580
More

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:05.420
thought-provoking.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:20.820
Today...

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:21.140
Bye.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:21.700
There was no winner.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:22.260
Really.

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:23.340
I was just lucky this time.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:24.260
Next time.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:24.780
I'm grateful.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:24.940
Okay.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:27.700
Ms. Gao.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:29.740
We welcome your valuable feedback.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.220
If you come to Shanghai,
please let me know.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.020
I'll pick you up myself.

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:32.780
Okay.

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:33.540
See you next time.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:33.980
Take care.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:40.100
Accurately capture

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.060
the proper taste

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:43.580
and aroma

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:45.820
of Pinot Noir

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:47.660
before pursuing uniqueness.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.500
I tasted Cygne's wine carefully.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.180
There was

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.020
no winner today.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:30.580
Dad!

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:32.460
Slow down.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.460
Did you win?

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:34.860
Yes! Champion!

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.180
Feng Lexuan

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:42.380
wins First Prize
in the 9th Model Airplane Competition.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:43.300
First place!

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.380
First prize! Let me see.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:47.860
Dad,

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.100
I want to award this to you.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.180
I achieved your dream for you.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:53.820
Wait.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:55.860
This is your dream.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.300
You should keep it.

00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:58.300
I'll achieve

00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:59.340
my own dreams myself.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:00.940
Then,

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.220
when I grow up,

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:03.580
can I go pursue my own dreams

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.060
without worrying about you?

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.180
Of course.

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.060
Even though we take off together,

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.980
we each have our own destination.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:11.140
Okay.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.660
Then I'll keep it myself.

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:14.500
Dad,

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.140
are you going to marry Ms. Wen?

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:19.820
You...

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:21.620
Look.

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:22.580
Ms. Wen is wearing

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:23.820
Grandma's pearl necklace.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.660
This is Grandma's heirloom.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.140
Why didn't you ask me earlier?

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.940
I was wondering
why you hadn't noticed it

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.060
all this time.

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.580
How could I miss
such an obvious necklace?

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:35.700
I won the championship,

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.700
and now I know
you two are getting married.

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.540
Is today my lucky day?

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:40.700
Ms. Wen,

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.780
how did you manage to win over my dad?

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.380
Win over?

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:46.180
You're too clever for your own age.

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:47.140
What are you talking about?

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.220
I'm the champion!
You can't mess with me!

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:50.820
Don't mess with me!

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:51.820
Ms. Wen, save me!

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:52.300
Stop fooling around.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:53.180
Hold still.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.720
[Cygne]

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:15.780
Leg position.

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:22.140
Be steady.

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:23.900
Very good.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:28.580
For a student

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.820
from a private ballet school
to be shortlisted

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:32.860
for such a prestigious competition

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:33.940
is a first.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.380
We believe Zheng Yufan will achieve

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:37.980
great results in this final.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:38.780
Thank you.

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.180
Ms. Guan,

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.500
I've been wanting to interview you

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.260
and only got the chance today.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.260
Your student made the shortlist.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.740
That's truly impressive.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:49.860
It's just making the shortlist.

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.300
It's still a remarkable achievement.

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.140
Thank you for the interview.

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:53.980
This will help

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:55.740
raise our school's profile.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:57.180
Of course.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:58.700
Ms. Guan,

00:29:58.900 --> 00:29:59.860
a question off-topic.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.580
I heard Tan Siting
started teaching at this school

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:04.140
after returning from France.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.500
So she's your colleague now.

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:07.860
Could you tell me

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:09.660
what she's like?

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.460
Is that part of today's interview topic?

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.220
No.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.220
This is purely my personal curiosity.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:21.700
Then you should schedule
a dedicated interview with Ms. Tan.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:22.700
That would satisfy

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.780
all your curiosity.

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.460
That would be wonderful.

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.460
Thank you

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:29.140
for participating

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.780
in the Ballet Enthusiast segment today.

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:31.420
Thank you.

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:32.260
No problem.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:34.980
What's wrong, Yufan?

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:37.580
Is it your back?

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:41.780
Your foot?

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:44.340
Did you twist it?

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.340
I don't know.

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:49.420
Lift your leg.

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.980
Anterior talar impact injury?

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:57.180
Last time, it hurt this badly too.

00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.460
I told her

00:30:58.620 --> 00:30:59.820
to stop and rest until fully recovered,

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:00.500
but she didn't listen.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.220
It's not a big deal.

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.660
Every dancer
sprains something a few times.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.740
The situation is different.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:12.020
None of your classmates
are injured as seriously as you.

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:13.500
You've been pushing yourself too hard.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.540
If it's severe,

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:16.860
a bone spur could develop.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:21.420
Can you do it?

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:23.780
Be careful with your foot.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:25.420
Sir.

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.380
If it's a bone spur,

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:28.940
surgery is required.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.620
But she's so young.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.620
If it doesn't heal properly this time,
it's really hard to say.

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:37.820
Mr. Zhang,

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:38.900
I...

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:40.580
Last time, I told you

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.140
to rest properly.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:42.980
But

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:44.860
Ms. Guan insisted you keep dancing.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:45.940
Well?

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.180
The same spot

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:48.500
is acting up again.

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:51.220
This time you must rest
until it's completely healed.

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.340
Or a bone spur might really form.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:54.780
If that happens,

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:56.620
then as Ms. Tan said,

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.100
surgery will be the only option.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:02.860
Ms. Guan made you dance?

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:05.140
No.

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:06.620
I wanted to dance myself.

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:12.900
I'm completely out of breath.

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:14.500
How could the dancing
turn out like this?

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.300
I don't know.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:15.860
Right?

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.180
Ms. Guan, I want to ask you something.

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:19.900
Go ahead.

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.180
I'll leave you two alone.

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:25.460
You knew Yufan's foot was injured,
didn't you?

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:26.780
Yes. Why?

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:29.820
The why did you

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:30.900
make her keep dancing

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:31.500
instead of letting her rest?

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:36.300
The submission deadline
for the competition video

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:37.500
was just over ten days away then.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:38.420
How could she stop?

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:39.580
And after the video was recorded?

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:40.780
Why didn't you let her rest then?

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.740
It didn't hurt anymore after that.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:46.540
Why should she rest?

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:49.260
So she kept dancing.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:50.820
Today, her foot is injured again.

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:52.340
In the same spot.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:55.460
So what do you want?

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:57.540
What do I want?

00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:59.140
She can't dance anymore.

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:00.780
Are you joking?

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:01.860
The final is coming soon!

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.420
This career is inherently tough.

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:09.020
Getting injured
for the sake of achievement is nothing.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:09.980
Everyone here

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.100
has been through it.

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:14.620
Have you never been injured
while dancing?

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:15.940
Which

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:16.780
holds more importance,

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.220
one competition

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:21.220
or her entire dancing career?

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:24.380
If a child, being young
and short-sighted,

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:25.940
plants a landmine for her future,

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:28.220
her dance career

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.460
will definitely be affected.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:31.940
You are her teacher.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.260
Do you want to see her
be a flash in the pan?

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:37.540
What are you talking about?

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.220
When I first entrusted her to you,

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:46.300
she was perfectly fine.

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.420
Now, in such a short time,

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.020
how did she end up like this?

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.980
Now that there's a problem,
you come to me?

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:55.060
We don't even know
whose responsibility it really is yet!

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:55.940
Fine.

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:57.460
Let's say it's my problem.

00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:59.420
So I've decided she won't dance anymore.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.620
Starting today, she needs to rest.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:04.020
Now is not the time to debate
whose problem or responsibility it is!

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:06.500
The urgent priority right now
is to compete

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:07.900
in the final and get results!

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.140
That is the most important thing

00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:10.060
for herself!

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:13.620
Ms. Guan,

00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:15.780
I see it differently.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.500
I believe compared to
her lifelong dance career,

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.140
one competition is nothing.

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.100
You're a ballet dancer too.

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.860
How can you
treat your student like this?

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:28.060
So you're the only one with high morals?

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:29.340
The only one who cares about students?

00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:31.140
You're all afraid of her, but I'm not,

00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:31.740
let me tell you!

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.140
Skipping one competition doesn't matter?

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:35.340
You make it sound so easy!

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.420
Of course it doesn't matter to you.

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:37.420
You're a genius.

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:37.820
Right?

00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:39.940
Missing one or two competitions
is nothing?

00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:41.660
Is it nothing for Zheng Yufan?

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:43.420
What right do you have
to make decisions for her?

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.340
What right do I have?

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.900
Because I am also a ballet dancer.

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:48.460
Because I am her teacher now.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:51.500
Ms. Zhuang,

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.660
my focus is entirely on the school

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:54.580
and the children.

00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:56.380
What did I do wrong?

00:34:58.420 --> 00:34:59.100
Ms. Guan,

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:01.140
don't be upset.

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:03.380
I think you might

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:05.940
have misunderstood Ms. Tan.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:08.900
Ms. Tan, please explain what's going on.

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:11.900
Yufan injured her foot again

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:13.540
during training today.

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.140
The doctor said
it's an anterior talar impact injury.

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.140
If this continues, she'll need surgery.

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.580
My opinion is that she should rest now

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.340
and resume training
after she's recovered.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.580
Is it really as serious as you say?

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.180
It's just a sprained foot.
I know it well.

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.220
Don't exaggerate.

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:31.660
Ms. Zhuang,

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:33.500
the final

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:34.460
is in just one month.

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:37.380
Every single minute now is crucial.

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.220
We've prepared for so long

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.420
just for this one push.

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:43.420
This level of competition
isn't just about skill.

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:44.260
It also depends on luck.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:46.100
No matter how skilled Yufan is,

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.300
she won't always have the luck

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:50.340
to make it to the final every time.

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:52.260
I know this competition

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.660
is very important to Yufan.

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:54.540
But no matter how important it is,

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:56.940
it's not more important

00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:58.980
than a foot injury that could affect
her dancing future for life.

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:00.940
If competing in this competition

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.100
means she'll have
a permanent health issue,

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.260
then I am firmly against it.

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:06.340
Ms. Zhuang,

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:08.820
I think Ms. Tan
is making a big deal out of it.

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:10.420
It's just a minor injury.

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:11.500
It shouldn't be escalated

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:12.780
to the level of a lifelong health issue.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:14.780
Yufan is a promising talent.

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.860
Seizing this opportunity
to achieve good results

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:17.860
is a chance

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:19.260
for both her and the school.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:21.580
It's about glory, honor.
It's a great thing.

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.820
I'm a simple person.
Not that complicated.

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.660
I'm only doing this
for the children and the school.

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:28.580
How is that my fault?

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:30.100
Why are you constantly targeting me?

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:31.500
Talking about being short-sighted?

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.580
Saying I'm planting landmines
for my students?

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:34.140
Just because you came back
from abroad, you think you're so great?

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:35.420
You want to bully everyone?

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:36.300
Lecture everyone?

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:37.940
You're being a bully.

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.260
I never bully anyone.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:40.780
I'm just calling it as I see it.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:42.900
Ms. Guan,

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:43.860
don't be mad.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:44.980
I really think

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.060
you've misunderstood Ms. Tan.

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:47.580
Misunderstood?

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:48.700
I don't think so.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:50.300
Why do you think
I've misunderstood her?

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:51.340
Ms. Zhuang.

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:53.820
Yufan, how's your foot?

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:54.820
Yufan, tell Ms. Zhuang

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.140
your foot is fine.

00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:58.700
You...

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:00.060
I'm fine, Ms. Zhuang.

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:01.860
Please don't blame Ms. Guan.

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.900
I agreed to keep practicing

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:06.220
last time I was injured.

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:09.340
I was afraid stopping
would delay my progress

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:09.980
and affect the competition.

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.620
Ms. Guan wanted me
to achieve good results.

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:15.220
I also wanted to push myself.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.460
See? I wasn't wrong, was I?

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:18.460
Yufan,

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:21.140
what did the doctor tell you today?

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.780
Ms. Tan, you're right.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.420
But you don't need to argue

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:27.060
about me anymore.

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:29.820
I don't want to
participate in this competition.

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:31.620
What kind of talk is that?

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.180
What do you mean
you don't want to participate?

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.060
You heard me correctly.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.660
That's exactly what I mean.

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:40.780
I don't want to participate anymore.

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:42.340
And you don't need to argue anymore.

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:43.180
But...

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:43.900
Yufan.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:44.380
Yufan.

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:45.820
We're at this point now.

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:46.700
You can't...

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:48.540
You can't just give up like this.

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:49.900
The final is about to start.

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:51.540
Let's persevere
a little longer, alright?

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:53.260
Ms. Tan and I won't argue anymore.

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:53.820
Bye, Madam.

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:55.860
Yufan!

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:56.580
Ms. Guan,

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.540
she has been
under a lot of pressure lately.

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.180
Let her calm down and think for herself.

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:01.580
Ms. Guan,

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:03.300
I know

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.900
you and Ms. Tan are both good teachers.

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.020
You both have
the students' best interests at heart.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.220
Sometimes,

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:11.380
people have different perspectives

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.260
when handling things.

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:14.500
That's perfectly normal.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:16.060
But

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.220
I hope you both
won't take it too personally.

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:20.340
We are colleagues.

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:22.820
Ms. Guan...

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:36.380
Ting,

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:38.900
the child is having a hard time.

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:41.700
She really has been
under a lot of pressure lately.

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:44.260
This is a chance

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.140
for her to take a break

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:47.100
and relax.

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:48.860
I know.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:52.740
Don't worry.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.620
He did pretty well in class today.

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:57.820
But when you go home,

00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:58.620
don't rush.

00:38:58.820 --> 00:38:59.740
Solidify the basics

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.740
and the scales properly.

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:02.180
Okay.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:02.900
Okay, Ms. Wen.

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:03.900
Bye, Ms. Wen.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:04.540
Okay. Bye.

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:04.980
Let's go.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:08.620
It's alright.

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:11.060
Just call me if you need anything.

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:12.340
Okay. Thank you, Ms. Tan.

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:13.380
Bye.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:14.380
Ms. Tan.

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:15.060
Ms. Wen.

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:15.940
Are your classes over?

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:19.340
You don't have classes today, right?

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:21.020
I just left something here

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.020
and came to pick it up.

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:25.140
If you're free,

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.260
could you come with me somewhere later?

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.260
Today, we're going to look
at a wedding venue.

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.820
I'm afraid of making choices.

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.660
Since you've lived abroad
for so many years,

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:36.260
your taste must be
much better than mine.

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:39.060
If you're free,
could you help me decide?

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:39.980
Sure.

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.140
Since Ms. Tan didn't have classes today,

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.740
I wanted to ask her to come along

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:51.620
and give her opinion.

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:53.740
I wasn't sure if it was appropriate.

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:56.180
It's perfectly appropriate.

00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:58.420
Yes, totally.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.100
Sorry for taking up your time.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:01.580
I'll treat you to a meal next time.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:02.940
No need to be so formal.

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:08.660
This

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:11.180
our featured styles.

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.060
It has a satin bodice

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:14.180
with excellent drape.

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:16.060
It looks very elegant when worn.

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.900
It also features a small V-neck.

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:20.060
Look, the small pearls

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:22.700
add a very gentle,
graceful feel for the bride.

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:24.260
This way, please.

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:26.100
Take a look.

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:29.500
We also have this strapless style.

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.340
This one features a large bow.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.300
The tulle is designed

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.940
in a layered, cake-like shape,

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.420
so it gives the bride

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:41.260
a playful and cute feeling.

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:42.660
Playful.

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.140
We have another style.

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.100
This is also a featured one.

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:50.020
It's made from classic lace.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.460
Many luxury brands

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.100
featured at international fashion weeks

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:55.820
use this fabric.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.180
Look, it has

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:00.660
a deep V-back design.

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.540
Which one do you think is better?

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:07.300
I think they all look nice.

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.860
Could you give some substantial advice?

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.500
You have great poise.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:13.660
You'd look good in any of them.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:17.100
But I'm afraid of making choices.

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:19.540
Ms. Tan, what do you think?

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:20.420
Which one is better?

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:25.220
I think maybe this one.

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:27.100
Because the fabric is very special,

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.580
and the back design is also beautiful.

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:32.660
Why not try it on?

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:33.900
Okay.

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:34.820
I'll try this one then.

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:35.380
Alright.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:38.980
Wait a moment.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:40.100
This way.

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:40.580
Okay.

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:41.580
The fitting room is over here.

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:00.020
This part is a bit loose.

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:03.380
If it were snugger, it would accentuate
the waistline more.

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:04.420
This works.

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:04.860
This is much better.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:05.340
This works, right?

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:05.740
Yes.

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:06.860
Just tighten it one more notch.

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:07.540
Make it a bit tighter.

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.380
Okay. I'll have

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:10.420
the designer

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:12.180
alter it accordingly.

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:17.820
Why did you come?

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.540
What? Are you afraid of seeing me?

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:31.860
Is there something you haven't told me?
