00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.080
A woman.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.600
Everyone's tired.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.960
Let's rest early.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.400
I'll take the couch.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.760
You...

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.000
Why are you here?

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.400
Actually, I...

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.000
am a man.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.400
So you are, too.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.800
I'll ask Sister-in-law to help you change.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.160
Hot...

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.960
I feel...

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.560
I'm so hot.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.960
I'll have Sister-in-law

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.120
help you change your clothes.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.960
No, you can't.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.360
They mustn't find out.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.720
No.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.200
Let Sister-in-law know...

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.440
No.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.760
No.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.640
Alright.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.360
Now then,

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.840
you can finally give up on Rui Yu.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.360
A heart isn't like a jewelry box.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.360
When you like someone,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.960
you open it and look.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.920
When you don't,

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.680
you close it and never touch it again.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.840
Mother.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.120
Don't worry about me.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.840
You should worry more about Imperial Brother.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.720
By the way,

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.160
Your Majesty and Wanwan

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.760
grew up together since childhood.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.280
Your Majesty, what do you think

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.840
of Wanwan?

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.320
Prime Minister Ming's daughter,

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.360
beautiful and wise.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.160
She's certainly good.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.040
If she becomes Empress,

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.840
I could worry less.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.960
Could it be

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.400
Your Majesty still minds what happened with Rui Yu?

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.560
I wouldn't dare.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.320
What happened to Brother Yu?

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.520
What happened back then?

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.280
It was Rui Yu's marriage.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.480
For various reasons,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.800
it's not for you to know.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.960
Mother.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.480
You didn't let Brother Yu marry me.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.280
That's not it.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.080
But...

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.320
You truly can't marry Rui Yu.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.520
Why not?

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.760
I always thought Imperial Brother stopped it.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.200
Turns out it was you, Mother.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.040
How could you block your children's happiness?

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.040
Still so unreasonable.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.800
I never thought I'd be exposed like this,

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.480
letting Nan Chenxiao discover I'm a woman.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.200
No matter what,

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.000
I've finally been honest with him.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.360
Lord Rui.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.120
Do you have nothing to say?

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.520
I'm sorry.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.760
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.400
It's just...

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.920
I never found the right chance.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.800
I didn't know

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.320
how to bring it up.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.040
I never noticed before,

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.640
but Rui Yu is so delicate.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.560
Slender shoulders,

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.160
a waist you could hold in one hand,

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.680
graceful wrists...

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.800
Chest...

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.480
clearly a dainty woman's body.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.160
That makes me look so foolish.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.040
Foolish to the extreme.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.440
You officials are so cunning.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.880
So everyone but Sister-in-law

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.320
was lying to me.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.160
Weren't you, too?

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.760
Is that the same?

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.120
I confessed on my own.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.080
The Rui family

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.120
is a distinguished family of officials.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.800
But Father had a rough career.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.000
He never achieved great success.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.760
He could only place his hopes

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.840
on his children.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.640
The officialdom is treacherous.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.840
Factions fight fiercely.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.480
This time, I was drugged—

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.080
that's the best proof.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.160
To survive in this court's whirlpool,

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.960
every step

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.400
must be taken with care.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.560
Since I was born,

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.680
Father raised me as a boy.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.240
At eight, I entered the palace

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.960
as the Crown Prince's companion.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.640
At sixteen, I became an Academician-in-waiting.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.920
Now, with the new ruler,

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.080
I've become a Grand Secretary.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.600
I've lamented

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.840
the world's unfairness.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.400
My two brothers had no interest in court.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.240
But they had the chance from birth.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.040
No matter how clever I am,

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.560
or how many good plans,

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.320
I still must give up myself

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.400
and struggle to survive.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.760
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.720
Rise.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.320
From now on,

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.280
you'll be His Highness's companion.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.600
Don't forget Father's advice.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.320
In ancient times, those who wished

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.440
to spread virtue across the land

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.120
first governed their country.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.720
To govern the country,

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.080
one must first order the family.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.520
You've had a hard time.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.080
Rui Yu

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.840
Though I cannot, as a woman,

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.280
enter private school

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.400
or serve in the court,

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.600
I can still strive to do better than men.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.600
If one day

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.320
I become a good minister for the people,

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.160
I will have no regrets.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:47.960
I never thought

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.400
she would be so much like me.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.440
Thank you

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.200
for saving me in the palace today

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.240
and keeping my identity secret.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.600
If you are unwilling,

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.400
I can ask Your Majesty

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
to let us separate.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.040
No.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.000
I mean,

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.640
since we both have secrets,

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.360
this arrangement works well.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.240
We can help hide each other's identity.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.560
That's true.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:26.680
You—

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.360
do you have someone you love?

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.080
No.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.160
Me neither.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:41.720
I mean,

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.160
that's for the best.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.800
Then rest early.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.440
I'll leave now.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:20.960
Imperial Brother

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:21.840
Look at this one.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:22.720
This one

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.320
is about a poor scholar

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.520
and a princess's love story.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.400
You,

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.080
always read these romance books.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.080
Then this one—

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.120
Imperial Brother,

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.440
you'll definitely like this one.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.600
It's by my favorite, Wang Guanshan.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.720
Martial arts romance.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.280
Qingyu Shusheng

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.840
and the princess's

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.840
legendary love story.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.160
Aren't these all scholars' love stories?

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.600
What's the difference?

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.520
Then let me

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.920
tell you another story.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.680
This one—

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.360
you've surely never heard it.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.000
Imperial Brother, listen closely.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.240
They

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.160
grew up together

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.720
as childhood friends.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.160
They understood each other deeply.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.120
Everyone around them

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.480
said they were meant to be.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.680
But happiness didn't last.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.600
The girl's father forbade their marriage.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.560
Guess what happened?

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.920
He secretly sent his daughter away.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:31.160
So—

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.040
what happened to the girl?

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.440
The young man

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.800
never stopped searching for her.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.120
He met many remarkable people

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.560
and learned many amazing skills.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.120
He finally found the girl.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.400
But sadly,

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.200
to avoid being defiled by villains,

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.400
the girl took her own life.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.120
The young man

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.440
was heartbroken.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.440
For the rest of his life,

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.720
he never married again.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.680
Are you sure

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.080
this is a love story?

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.000
Of course it is!

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:06.680
See, a man and a woman—

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.760
a man and a woman—

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.160
joy, sorrow, love, desire—

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:10.840
it's all there!

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.920
What else could it be?

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.040
Miss Ming,

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:14.720
please.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.800
How is this story?

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.320
It's not bad.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.440
That's because I told it well.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.280
Your Majesty, I greet you.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.080
Princess.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.000
Wanwan.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.200
Miss Ming,

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.920
why aren't you in the Empress Dowager's palace?

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.640
What brings you here?

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.520
The Empress Dowager said Your Majesty has worked hard lately,

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.080
so she sent me to bring some pastries.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.760
Wanwan,

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.080
look, Imperial Brother is so stern.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.400
Enough.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.480
That's not what Your Majesty meant.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.120
Come.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.920
I'm sorry.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.760
It's all my fault.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.200
I made Brother Yu fall into the water.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.600
And made Imperial Brother angry.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.400
Imperial Brother was right to ground me.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.040
But it's already

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.160
been a whole day.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.080
Isn't it time I go to Rui Manor and apologize?

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.000
All thunder, no rain.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.800
That's too fake.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.280
Are you annoyed with me?

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.160
Then I'll go.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.520
Go on, then.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.640
Lights fill the city on all sides.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.240
The Milky Way flows through the river's heart.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.800
Have you ever been to the lakeside before?

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:00.840
No, I haven't.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.120
Before this,

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.480
I always came by carriage,

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.240
rushing in and out in a hurry.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:06.880
Thinking about it now,

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.160
I missed so much beautiful scenery.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.720
Don't you feel regret?

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.360
Why would I regret it?

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.200
For example,

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.400
the court struggles are so dangerous,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.960
draining and exhausting.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.760
Or,

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.520
losing my freedom.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.440
Just staying inside the house.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.400
Freedom?

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.320
At least it's stable.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.320
Most women's lives

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.320
are spent moving from one home

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.120
to another through marriage,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
wasting their whole lives.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.520
I can do what I want to do,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.600
and contribute to the people's welfare.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.560
So I am truly grateful.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.000
She isn't seeking rank or promotion.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.760
She's a woman with ambition.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.400
I was too narrow-minded.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:54.960
It's just that sometimes,

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.720
when I see these bright young girls,

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.760
in my heart,

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.560
I can't help but feel a little longing.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.920
If one day

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.960
women could serve as officials in court...

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.400
But let's talk about you.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:11.440
Me?

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.760
I often see scenery like this.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.200
But

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.400
it's always from rooftops

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.080
or street corners.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.040
It's bittersweet.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.040
Candied hawthorn!

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:25.920
Over here!

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.080
You two,

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:27.960
would you like a skewer?

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.120
We'll take one.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.120
Alright!

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:30.960
Here you go, hold it tight.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:31.760
Thank you.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.920
Candied hawthorn.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:36.720
Go ahead, try it.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:37.480
It's very sweet.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.080
If I could live as a man,

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.360
I could serve my country,

00:16:58.920 --> 00:16:59.840
and protect peace in my land.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.680
So that's the kind of person he is.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.600
If the Military Imperial Examination succeeds,

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.600
he could earn great honor too.

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.600
Free from the constraints of being a woman,

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.040
away from the chaos of the capital,

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.520
and away from the Rui family.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.040
Do you want to go boating on the lake?

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.200
Sure!

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.760
If you want to,

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.680
that boat hasn't lit its lantern yet.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.360
Let's hurry over there.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.640
Let's go.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.560
Rui Yu doesn't get involved in factional strife.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.680
He relies on Your Majesty's favor.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.600
No one

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.800
dares to act rashly against him.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.400
But Prince Pan is his maternal cousin.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.200
Why is he pressuring him like this?

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.800
The Rui family are all upright officials.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.840
If pushed too far, it will destroy everyone.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.040
Prime Minister Ming,

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:06.960
this principle

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.480
you should understand better than I do, right?

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.600
If the Rui family doesn't know their place,

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.600
you know what I

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.760
will have to do.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.680
Today I finally shook off the surveillance.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.720
Prime Minister Ming,

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.160
surely you didn't just

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.840
come here to warn me?

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.080
About the matter you asked me to handle,

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.480
the ones we caught

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.720
were all beggars.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.920
None of them were

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.360
the mysterious Blade you mentioned.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.080
Maybe

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.800
I was just being paranoid.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.640
But staying alert isn't a bad thing.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.400
Let's expand the search

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.120
to cover the whole city.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.000
Prime Minister Ming,

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.280
just a small token.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:02.760
Hope you don't mind.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.520
Prince Pan, you

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.200
are really straightforward.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:07.880
I...

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.480
That's not what I meant.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:12.560
Pleasure working with you.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:14.920
Pleasure working with you.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.280
Come on.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.520
Be careful.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:22.840
I...

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.240
I was just trying to get the boat.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.480
Don't take it the wrong way.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:26.760
I didn't.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.160
You spend all day

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.080
either in the study

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.320
or at the Hanlin Academy.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.000
Don't you feel bored?

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.160
Compared to court disputes,

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.960
reading brings peace of mind.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.200
Do you feel

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.480
stifled staying at home?

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.720
If you ever want to go somewhere,

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:49.640
just tell me.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.040
I'll go with you.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.640
If you want to go anywhere,

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.040
I can go with you too.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.480
Let's go, get on the boat.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.320
We've docked.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:25.880
Prime Minister Ming,

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.120
Rui Yu,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.040
Madam Rui is here too.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.480
You two have such refined taste.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.440
I won't disturb your outing as a couple.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:38.520
Please.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.360
Boatman.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.040
Then, Prime Minister Ming,

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.280
please make yourself at home.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.480
Let's go, Madam.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:51.760
You two, please.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.080
Take care.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.360
Prince Pan

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.680
Seems closely connected to Prime Minister Ming

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.440
If Sister-in-law stays here one day

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.040
he'll have a reason to visit

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.280
If this keeps up

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.280
it could threaten Nan Chenxiao

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.400
Something on your mind?

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.680
No

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.520
I was just thinking

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.120
Let's move out and live on our own

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.440
Why do we need to move out?

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:48.920
We

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.680
are married now, after all

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.440
Living separately

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.080
would be more convenient

00:21:58.920 --> 00:21:59.720
Alright

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:10.840
Master

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.600
If there's a suitable place

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.160
Moving out

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.640
isn't that easy

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.040
The house

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.240
needs to be set up anew

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:35.960
Right

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:36.880
Exactly

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.560
This new residence, right?

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.280
The furniture

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.080
and the decor all need to be redone

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:41.920
Let me tell you

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.800
There's a lot going on behind the scenes

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.240
Your elder brother does this for a living

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:46.960
And besides

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:47.720
Well

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.640
Second Brother just returned

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:50.960
and you're moving out already

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.360
How will Second Brother feel?

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.080
I think Rui Yu moving out

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.000
is a good idea

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:57.720
Yes, go ahead and move

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:00.720
Why did you hit me?

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:01.840
Did I say something wrong?

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:05.880
Hopeless fool

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.360
It's really hard work

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:04.840
Liang

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:06.920
It's you

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.320
Take a break

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:10.640
I'm not tired

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.280
You came at just the right time

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:13.720
Take a look at this

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.840
Where's the bedroom?

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.320
Right here

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.920
It's on the south side of the main hall

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.040
It's a great location

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.640
Are we sharing a room?

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.120
Th-this is your room

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:37.400
I

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.320
I'll stay

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.160
in another courtyard

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.520
I'm just joking with you

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.360
In a few months

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.720
it'll be the Spring Imperial Examination

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.800
The list of those who passed the local exam

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.400
should be arriving soon

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.040
Then

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.240
what about the Military Imperial Examination?

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.200
I've been working on it

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.720
But the conflict between civil and military

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.600
can't be resolved overnight

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.320
In the court

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.040
many officials still oppose it

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.680
So

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.360
it's an expected outcome

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.080
Trust me

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.600
I'll make it happen

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:40.800
I trust you

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.480
Then take a look at this

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.280
This training ground

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.800
Should it be bigger?

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.080
It's big enough already

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.080
No need to make it bigger

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.560
This is the library

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.560
and also my study

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.120
It's close to your room

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.040
Quick

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:03.520
Move it up

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.440
Little Dazi

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.200
Miss Qiuhong

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.120
Are these gifts for the Rui family?

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:12.600
Yes

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.800
The princess wants to send some things too

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.160
Please deliver them all together

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.720
That might be a bit...

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.880
It's fine, it's fine

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.120
Move that box up as well

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:25.520
Go ahead and move it

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.320
Yes, yes

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.440
Be careful

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:30.800
Did you hear? Be careful

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.200
Handle with care

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.520
Set it down gently

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:34.880
Let's go

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.320
Greetings, Sir

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.920
Greetings, Madam

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.400
Go inside and have a look

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.320
From now on, all household matters

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.320
will be managed by Madam

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.480
Everyone, please support her

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:05.800
Thank you for your efforts

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.600
Yes, yes

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.800
I'll show you the training ground

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:10.520
Alright

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:17.640
How is it?

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.280
It's great

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.360
Try it out, see if it suits you

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:05.920
Come on, come on

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.240
Move it forward

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:08.600
Watch out

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:10.080
Slow down

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.520
Even moving in, there are guards

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.600
Being an official is nice

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.840
This way, this way, this way

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.040
Be careful

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:18.640
Alright

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:19.960
Slow down, slow down

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.560
Put it here

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.240
Don't rush, be careful

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.320
Handle it gently

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.800
Thank you for your hard work

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.240
Thank you, everyone

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.280
Go to the front hall for some fruit and tea

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.280
Thank you, Madam

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.160
This way, please

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:35.000
Let's go

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:35.960
Please

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:37.120
Thank you for your hard work

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.280
Where is Brother Yu, anyway?

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:45.880
Princess

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.640
Are you alright?

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:02.880
Miss

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:14.880
What are you doing?

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.480
Helping you recover your spirit

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:17.840
No need to thank me

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.600
What are you writing?

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:27.920
It's confidential

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:31.520
Speaking of which

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.240
Which palace are you a maid from?

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.680
I am Princess Chunxi.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.560
A palace maid.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:39.920
The princess sent me to the residence.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.320
To deliver a message to Master Rui.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.440
Can you take me to see him?

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.520
He has moved out.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.680
When did he move out?

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.600
Just this morning.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.080
If you had come an hour earlier,

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.120
maybe

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:56.840
you could have caught him.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:57.320
Well,

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.040
where did he move to?

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.800
Do you need something from him?

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:04.960
Alright.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:05.960
I'll take you.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.280
Really?

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:07.920
Really.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.000
By the way,

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.880
I still don't know who you are.
