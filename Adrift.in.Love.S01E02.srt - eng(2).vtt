How's it going, Tony? You miss me?

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:12.939
My dear Yi Fu, are you coming today?

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:14.247
I can't, I have plans.

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:16.141
Damn, which girl is it today?

00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:19.711
It's the 87th blind date
arranged by Ms. Qian Li Hua.

00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:22.981
Wow, your mom really won't give up.

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:24.733
Why are you so obedient this time?

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.359
I dare you to miss it.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.969
I don't have the guts for that now.

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:31.039
This time, it's Lin Feng Hua,
my mom's top pick for a daughter-in-law.

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.029
My mom will kill me if I don't appear.

00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:39.256
- Hello?
- Xin Yi Fu, are you there yet?

00:00:39.256 --> 00:00:41.066
I'm almost there.

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.751
Why aren't you there yet?

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:45.045
I finally arranged a date
with Mr. Lin's daughter.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.513
How dare you be late?

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:49.848
Would it kill her if she waited a little?

00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:52.927
Are you chickening out again?

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:55.188
I didn't mean to.

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:57.031
If you keep annoying me, I'll...

00:00:58.748 --> 00:01:00.335
Hello?

Hey!

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.498
Fuck!

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:22.363
What the hell?

00:01:23.567 --> 00:01:26.820
Miss, are you all right?

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.921
Hey.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.422
I didn't hit you just now.

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:30.455
There's still some space here.

00:01:30.455 --> 00:01:32.242
I didn't hit you.

00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:33.618
Are you okay?

Congratulations to Mr. Fan Yue Jiao
for winning the bid.

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.458
Let's welcome Mr. Fan
to the stage to say a few words.

00:02:31.793 --> 00:02:33.536
Thank you for your kindness,
General Manager Fan.

00:02:33.536 --> 00:02:35.597
I'm sure everyone is curious.

00:02:35.597 --> 00:02:37.489
Why are you so insistent on this auction item?

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.017
Why do you like it so much?

00:02:39.017 --> 00:02:42.328
Can you share your joy with everyone?

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:46.680
Actually, Dr. Gu was the one

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.740
who asked me to do this.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.782
He told me to keep a low profile.

00:02:53.782 --> 00:02:56.180
But I really can't help

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.820
but want to share this joy with everyone.

00:03:00.905 --> 00:03:02.749

Thank you again
for your kindness, General Manager Fan.

Engagement? When did that happen?

00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:25.338
We've been dating for six years.

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:28.089
What else will be our next step?

00:03:29.893 --> 00:03:33.505
Do you know our health center is losing money?

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:37.909
I don't have money for you
to do charity or buy such a diamond ring.

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.555
That's why we need to be generous
and make people think we're rich.

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:44.724
Then someone will invest in us.

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.542
Trust me, someone will take the bait.

Do you think everyone is stupid?

And why didn't you discuss it with me first?

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.116
If I had told you first, would you have agreed?

00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:04.192
I'll be careful next time.

Okay, you can fly.

- Do you know her?
- She's my friend.

She told you not to touch her.
Why did you touch her?

No, she really is my friend.

It's Sunday.

No birthday cake.

No one to celebrate it with.

How about this?

Happy birthday.

00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:12.463
Can you sing "Happy Birthday" to me?

Please?

Where's the cake?

I already sang "Happy Birthday" to you,
and you still want a cake?

Don't ask for too much.

These are candles, three candles.

Isn't it your 30th birthday?

00:12:33.402 --> 00:12:35.988
And this is the candlelight.

It stinks.

00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:28.826
Stinks like hell.

00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:30.160
Sour.

What do you think?

00:14:31.161 --> 00:14:34.987
Did you skip the blind date
because you saved a hottie?

00:14:34.987 --> 00:14:36.292
It was crazy.

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:39.003
I've never met anyone so drunk
and with such stinky puke.

00:14:39.003 --> 00:14:40.154
I shouldn't have saved her.

Oh, come on.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:42.411
You found an excuse to skip the blind date.

00:14:42.411 --> 00:14:44.466
Who saved who here, huh?

00:14:44.466 --> 00:14:46.385
So what if I have a good excuse?

00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:49.346
Ms. Qian Li Hua still won't
let me off the hook.

00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:50.389
Fine.

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:53.058
Then break free from your mom.

00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:55.044
You want to enjoy the perks
of being in a rich family,

00:14:55.044 --> 00:14:57.816
but also want to be uninhibited and free.

Wow, it rhymes.

00:14:59.942 --> 00:15:03.986
Mr. Xin, you can't have it all.

00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:06.364
You're really bad at chatting.
No wonder you're single forever.

- Yi Fu.
- Single dog.

Of course, why wouldn't I?

00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:19.897
I'll send you the address then.

Okay, I've sent it to you.

Who are you?

You're the one who was
really drunk earlier, aren't you?

00:15:54.436 --> 00:15:57.024
This is my phone.
I think we switched phones by mistake.

00:15:57.024 --> 00:16:02.319
You scammers are really innovative,
but I'm broke!

00:16:02.319 --> 00:16:04.212
Hang on.

00:16:09.443 --> 00:16:11.220
I'm trying to sleep here!

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.052
Hey.

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:43.168
Why am I here?

00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:46.028
Miss, did you black out?

00:16:47.531 --> 00:16:49.476
Drink this.

00:16:53.554 --> 00:16:55.257
I'll sleep a bit more.

00:16:55.257 --> 00:16:57.838
Wake me up at seven.

00:17:04.873 --> 00:17:06.316
Breakfast is ready.

00:17:06.316 --> 00:17:07.952
I'm not hungry.

00:17:07.952 --> 00:17:10.034
Come and sit down.

00:17:10.946 --> 00:17:13.515
Why did you stand Lin Feng Hua up?

00:17:13.515 --> 00:17:17.074
Do you know how much effort
I put into setting this up?

00:17:17.074 --> 00:17:20.548
That's why we shouldn't look for trouble,

00:17:20.548 --> 00:17:22.091
or a princess to serve.

00:17:22.091 --> 00:17:24.863
Lin Feng Hua isn't a princess.

00:17:26.729 --> 00:17:29.863
She started a startup in the US.

00:17:29.863 --> 00:17:32.518
I heard it's doing really well.

00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:34.530
Look at you.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:40.032
She's much more capable than you.

00:17:42.811 --> 00:17:45.725
That's right, everyone else is better.

00:17:45.725 --> 00:17:47.571
Your son is the worst.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.345
You're just selling your son.

00:17:51.345 --> 00:17:53.430
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:56.033
Lin Feng Hua is capable
and has a good background.

00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:58.435
What reason do you have to dislike her?

00:17:58.435 --> 00:18:00.479
I might like her.

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:03.123
But you can't order me to like her.

00:18:03.123 --> 00:18:04.416
How about this?

00:18:04.416 --> 00:18:08.837
Today, buy Lin Feng Hua a gift
and apologize.

00:18:08.837 --> 00:18:12.308
And get to know her better.

00:18:12.308 --> 00:18:13.988
Okay.

00:18:14.943 --> 00:18:16.453
I'm so sleepy.

00:18:16.453 --> 00:18:17.746
Thank you for breakfast.

00:18:17.746 --> 00:18:19.431
I'm going to bed now.

00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:21.558
Xin Yi Fu!

00:18:21.558 --> 00:18:23.548
Xin Yi Fu!

00:18:27.715 --> 00:18:29.528
Still can't sleep well?

00:18:30.448 --> 00:18:33.032
I wouldn't be here if I could.

00:18:43.372 --> 00:18:46.275
Today, let's talk about your past.

00:18:46.275 --> 00:18:48.343
Come on, I just need sleeping pills.

00:18:48.343 --> 00:18:51.278
You don't have to dig up my past.

00:19:09.623 --> 00:19:12.259
So, do you want to talk about the past?

00:19:14.528 --> 00:19:16.013
Sure.

00:19:16.797 --> 00:19:19.224
My dad was an alcoholic.

00:19:19.224 --> 00:19:22.911
He would beat my mom and me
when he got drunk.

00:19:22.911 --> 00:19:24.997
When my dad died in a car accident,

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:27.999
my mom and I bought wine and celebrated.

00:19:32.212 --> 00:19:36.809
After my dad died,
my mom kept dating new men.

00:19:36.809 --> 00:19:38.863
She didn't work.

00:19:39.636 --> 00:19:43.624
So, whenever a man left, we ran out of money.

00:19:43.624 --> 00:19:47.104
My mom couldn't take it anymore,
so she left, too.

00:19:47.104 --> 00:19:48.955
So, I became an unwanted orphan.

00:19:48.955 --> 00:19:50.829
That's why I'm sick.

00:19:52.633 --> 00:19:54.915
Is that what you want to hear?

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:58.554
And then?

00:20:00.132 --> 00:20:02.478
You believe such a dramatic story?

00:20:02.478 --> 00:20:06.041
I believe there's a reason
behind everything a patient says.

00:20:10.651 --> 00:20:13.511
Then in high school, I had a crush on a senior.

00:20:15.697 --> 00:20:18.010
But he raped me.

00:20:28.032 --> 00:20:32.856
Do you want to talk about it? No pressure.

00:20:32.856 --> 00:20:34.999
I don't feel pressured.

00:20:34.999 --> 00:20:37.053
Do you want the details?

00:20:40.172 --> 00:20:42.157
I merely confessed to him.

00:20:42.157 --> 00:20:45.085
But he passionately hugged me.

00:20:45.085 --> 00:20:48.017
He forcefully kissed my lips.

00:20:48.939 --> 00:20:51.770
He sucked my neck hard.

00:20:58.204 --> 00:21:00.337
And then...

00:21:06.081 --> 00:21:08.941
Do you want to hear more?

00:21:08.941 --> 00:21:11.319
You remember all the details.

00:21:12.829 --> 00:21:14.898
Do you think about it often?

00:21:14.898 --> 00:21:16.784
Of course.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.634
He grabbed my hair
and hit my head against the wall.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.659
He took off my underwear.

00:21:25.659 --> 00:21:31.103
Violently, over and over again,
he penetrated...

00:21:34.318 --> 00:21:36.137
I was in so much pain.

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.274
I was truly in so much pain.

00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:59.691
How was it? Did I tell a good story?

00:22:01.303 --> 00:22:02.696
Was it fun?

00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:04.728
It was so fun.

00:22:09.203 --> 00:22:12.773
You psychiatrists have
an interesting profession.

00:22:12.773 --> 00:22:15.285
You get to hear a lot of patients' secrets.

00:22:16.418 --> 00:22:18.387
If you don't trust me,

00:22:18.387 --> 00:22:20.481
why are you here today?

00:22:21.406 --> 00:22:24.536
There must be something I need here.

00:22:30.557 --> 00:22:32.036
Do you smoke?

00:22:32.882 --> 00:22:35.514
No. Why?

00:22:38.565 --> 00:22:40.968
I'll prescribe you some medicine today.

00:22:40.968 --> 00:22:44.655
If you want to come again,
call and make an appointment.

00:22:44.655 --> 00:22:46.323
You'll prescribe medicine for me today?

00:22:46.323 --> 00:22:48.373
Yes.

00:22:48.373 --> 00:22:50.434
Are you giving up on me?

00:22:51.394 --> 00:22:54.254
It's always the patients
who give up on themselves.

00:23:07.361 --> 00:23:10.789
Take it 15 to 30 minutes before you go to bed.

00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:12.267
If I have any questions for Dr. Gu...

00:23:12.267 --> 00:23:14.245
The clinic's number is on the packet.

00:23:14.245 --> 00:23:16.466
You can call for consultation.

00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:20.458
Thank you.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:30.410
­

00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:59.440
­

00:24:41.246 --> 00:24:44.649
And here, it's this year's...

00:24:51.448 --> 00:24:54.082
Your call will be forwarded.

00:25:00.724 --> 00:25:02.083
Where were we?

00:25:02.083 --> 00:25:06.000
Please take a look at this year's
marketing budget plan, Vice President.

00:25:10.752 --> 00:25:12.518
What's wrong?

00:25:13.678 --> 00:25:15.931
My phone got switched with someone else's.

00:25:15.931 --> 00:25:17.157
Now it's off.

00:25:17.157 --> 00:25:19.495
Is he trying to steal my phone?

00:25:20.533 --> 00:25:21.903
Then you take his.

00:25:21.903 --> 00:25:25.090
His phone is newer than yours. You're lucky.

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:26.950
You're right.

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:29.638
No, I still have to find a way
to switch it back.

00:25:29.638 --> 00:25:31.454
He's probably more anxious than you are.

00:25:31.454 --> 00:25:33.862
Just wait for him to contact you.

00:25:35.911 --> 00:25:38.972
Mr. Zhan's girlfriend didn't like
the bracelet we picked out last time.

00:25:38.972 --> 00:25:40.132
She wants a refund.

00:25:40.132 --> 00:25:42.734
Can you go with her for me?

00:25:44.251 --> 00:25:46.295
Here's the receipt.

00:25:51.051 --> 00:25:53.249
It's okay. Let's do it this way.

00:25:53.249 --> 00:25:54.325
Okay.

00:25:54.325 --> 00:25:57.722
We'll ask the chairman for his opinion.

00:25:57.722 --> 00:25:59.967
Why ask the chairman?

00:25:59.967 --> 00:26:00.995
Because...

00:26:00.995 --> 00:26:03.186
Because the chairman has instructed us.

00:26:03.186 --> 00:26:04.646
We have to consult him
about everything you do.

00:26:04.646 --> 00:26:07.048
Fine, forget it. Ask him if you want.

00:26:07.048 --> 00:26:08.700
Get back to work.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.740
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:22.606
Hello.

00:26:22.606 --> 00:26:24.787
Hello, I'm looking for Miss Zhou Xiao Qi.

00:26:24.787 --> 00:26:26.253
Mr. Zhao asked me to come here.

00:26:26.253 --> 00:26:29.439
Miss Zhou is in the office.
Please wait a moment.

00:26:49.799 --> 00:26:52.817
I only said a few words to Mr. Zhao
and she sent you here?

00:26:53.678 --> 00:26:55.844
You're Miss Zhou?

00:26:58.892 --> 00:27:00.899
Do you have the receipt?

00:27:01.853 --> 00:27:03.526
Yes.

00:27:05.515 --> 00:27:08.151
Miss, would you like
to consider another design?

00:27:08.151 --> 00:27:12.047
No, just proceed with a refund. Thank you.

00:27:12.047 --> 00:27:13.883
The receipt.

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:23.963
Thank you.

00:27:29.422 --> 00:27:31.716
Is there a problem?

00:27:31.716 --> 00:27:34.627
Of course not. Please wait a moment.

00:27:49.693 --> 00:27:52.053
Speak your mind.

00:27:57.259 --> 00:27:59.369
Ms. Zhou.

00:27:59.369 --> 00:28:02.141
This gift is from Mr. Zhan.

00:28:02.141 --> 00:28:04.249
Won't doing this hurt his feelings?

00:28:04.249 --> 00:28:07.252
Is it better to pretend
to like something I don't?

00:28:07.252 --> 00:28:11.464
But it's impolite to return
someone's gift for cash.

00:28:11.464 --> 00:28:13.283
It's mine if it's been given to me.

00:28:13.283 --> 00:28:16.747
Why do I have to consider others' feelings
when it's my possession?

00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:21.891
Did you pick out that bracelet?

00:28:21.891 --> 00:28:23.725
Yes.

00:28:28.815 --> 00:28:32.883
Are you targeting me
because I reported you for shoplifting?

00:28:41.469 --> 00:28:43.246
How can someone be so annoying?

00:28:43.246 --> 00:28:46.794
Just because she's the boss's girlfriend,
she's so arrogant.

00:28:47.667 --> 00:28:49.763
An eyeopener, right?

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.297
Chief Secretary.

00:28:52.297 --> 00:28:55.550
Tell me, why are all rich people jerks?

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:58.027
Then do you want to be a rich jerk?

00:28:58.027 --> 00:29:01.018
- Of course.
- You've got your answer.

00:29:06.931 --> 00:29:09.509
Do you want to consider transferring here?

00:29:10.765 --> 00:29:12.484
Transferring here?

00:29:12.484 --> 00:29:13.929
I'll recommend you to Mr. Zhan.

00:29:13.929 --> 00:29:19.065
It's not tiring, and the pay is better.

00:29:19.065 --> 00:29:20.492
A secretary?

00:29:20.492 --> 00:29:21.993
But I specialize in marketing.

00:29:21.993 --> 00:29:24.996
Don't think secretaries only run errands.

00:29:24.996 --> 00:29:28.057
Working with the big boss
will increase your capabilities.

00:29:28.057 --> 00:29:29.476
You'll have more opportunities.

00:29:29.476 --> 00:29:32.670
Connections will help you in the future.

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.839
Don't be so ignorant.

00:29:38.153 --> 00:29:40.929
Okay, I'll think about it.

00:29:40.929 --> 00:29:42.546
I'll get to work.

00:29:56.633 --> 00:29:58.107
Hey.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.360
­

00:30:27.367 --> 00:30:29.996
You look so different from yesterday.

00:30:34.791 --> 00:30:37.710
Happy birthday to you.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:40.470
Happy birthday to you.

00:30:41.589 --> 00:30:42.741
I'm sorry.

00:30:42.741 --> 00:30:45.452
I blacked out yesterday, so I needed to recall.

00:30:45.452 --> 00:30:48.373
You blacked out yesterday
and don't remember anything?

00:30:48.373 --> 00:30:50.380
You made me so miserable.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.547
It's my loss.

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:55.795
Thank you for yesterday.

00:30:55.795 --> 00:30:59.407
The police said you saved me
from being taken advantage of.

00:30:59.407 --> 00:31:01.718
I'll treat you to a meal sometime.

00:31:01.718 --> 00:31:03.219
Sometime? People just say that.

00:31:03.219 --> 00:31:04.804
No, I have to go to work later.

00:31:04.804 --> 00:31:06.694
We can just switch our phones back.

00:31:29.787 --> 00:31:32.231
Then that's that.

00:31:34.125 --> 00:31:35.988
Yeah, what else can we do?

00:31:36.786 --> 00:31:38.988
Nothing. Thank you.

00:31:38.988 --> 00:31:40.518
Bye.

00:31:50.644 --> 00:31:52.311
- Hello, do you have a reservation?
- Yes.

00:31:52.311 --> 00:31:54.788
- What's your name?
- Gu.

00:31:54.788 --> 00:31:55.880
Mr. Gu.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.082
This way, please.

00:32:04.798 --> 00:32:07.242
Sparkling or mineral water?

00:32:07.242 --> 00:32:10.104
- Mineral water.
- Okay, please wait.

00:32:16.378 --> 00:32:19.535
Dr. Gu, what a coincidence.

00:32:19.535 --> 00:32:21.914
Are you waiting for someone?

00:32:21.914 --> 00:32:23.481
Yes.

00:32:24.843 --> 00:32:27.470
Do you mind if I sit for a while?

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:31.530
I'm sorry, but I don't
usually eat with my patients.

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:33.074
Oh.

00:32:48.783 --> 00:32:50.727
Why is she here?

00:32:53.098 --> 00:32:55.494
Hello, here is your water.

00:32:56.457 --> 00:32:58.025
Thank you.

00:32:59.085 --> 00:33:00.686
Enjoy.

00:33:07.122 --> 00:33:10.152
I made the capital increase proposal.

00:33:25.111 --> 00:33:27.879
Our sales aren't even this good.

00:33:29.799 --> 00:33:32.140
Didn't I tell you before?

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:34.287
This is fraud.

00:33:34.287 --> 00:33:36.163
It's not that serious.

00:33:36.163 --> 00:33:37.957
How is it fraud?

00:33:37.957 --> 00:33:40.568
Our sales will definitely get better.

00:33:40.568 --> 00:33:44.258
Those investors will be thrilled.

00:33:44.258 --> 00:33:47.273
Really, trust me.

00:33:50.135 --> 00:33:52.279
Don't be so anxious.

00:34:02.192 --> 00:34:04.209
- Perfect.
- Okay.

00:34:04.209 --> 00:34:06.585
Yeah, I think that's it.
Ditch those annoying chords.

00:34:06.585 --> 00:34:08.253
- Got it.
- You're overthinking it.

00:34:08.253 --> 00:34:10.823
- Okay? That's it.
- Okay.

00:34:13.557 --> 00:34:18.767
Manager, can I work two more hours a day?

00:34:18.767 --> 00:34:21.584
You think this is a KTV where you can
add hours as you please?

00:34:21.584 --> 00:34:23.577
Don't you have a full-time job?

00:34:23.577 --> 00:34:25.688
- You'll burn out!
- No, I won't.

00:34:25.688 --> 00:34:27.099
Stop fooling around.

00:34:27.099 --> 00:34:29.573
- Hey, Tony.
- Yi Fu.

00:34:34.054 --> 00:34:35.983
What are you doing here?

00:34:37.216 --> 00:34:39.451
I work here.

00:34:39.451 --> 00:34:41.370
Do you come here often?

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:43.522
He's the boss here.

00:34:43.522 --> 00:34:45.482
You two know each other?

00:34:45.482 --> 00:34:47.983
- Yes.
- Not really.

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:53.532
Hello, sir.

00:34:55.718 --> 00:34:58.329
♪ Listen to my confusion ♪

00:34:58.329 --> 00:35:01.807
♪ Fill the hole in my heart ♪

00:35:01.807 --> 00:35:08.522
♪ Breaking my curse ♪

00:35:08.522 --> 00:35:09.773
♪ About you and... ♪

00:35:09.773 --> 00:35:11.890
You know this song?

00:35:12.693 --> 00:35:14.470
It's my favorite band.

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:16.071
You like Sunset Sea, too?

00:35:16.071 --> 00:35:17.429
I love them!

00:35:17.429 --> 00:35:19.700
I work here because of them.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:23.395
It's awesome to make money
while listening to them sing.

00:35:23.395 --> 00:35:25.456
They're so unpopular.

00:35:25.456 --> 00:35:26.565
Why do you like them?

00:35:26.565 --> 00:35:29.652
I like what I like.
Who cares if they're unpopular?

00:35:29.652 --> 00:35:31.670
I'm just weird, I guess.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:33.255
But Tony gets me.

00:35:33.255 --> 00:35:35.119
I can't believe he invited them to sing.

00:35:35.119 --> 00:35:39.403
Tony? Impossible, he has such bad taste.

00:35:39.403 --> 00:35:40.929
I picked them.

00:35:40.929 --> 00:35:42.848
You're a Sea fan?

00:35:42.848 --> 00:35:44.349
I rarely meet like-minded people.

00:35:44.349 --> 00:35:46.101
When I mention them, no one ever gets it.

00:35:46.101 --> 00:35:47.548
Are you free this Friday?

00:35:47.548 --> 00:35:48.792
They're performing here.

00:35:48.792 --> 00:35:50.513
Want to watch them together?

00:35:51.969 --> 00:35:54.176
Darn it.

00:35:54.176 --> 00:35:56.303
Their songs are not my style at all.

00:35:56.303 --> 00:35:58.222
I can't imagine anyone liking their songs.

00:35:58.222 --> 00:36:00.491
And two of them at once.

00:36:00.491 --> 00:36:02.351
You have no taste.

00:36:02.351 --> 00:36:04.068
Table four.

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:12.836
What?

00:36:12.836 --> 00:36:14.431
Don't flirt with the staff.

00:36:14.431 --> 00:36:15.409
It's a pain to find new hires.

00:36:15.409 --> 00:36:19.172
I know. I'm not stupid enough
to ask for trouble.

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:21.620
­

00:36:53.585 --> 00:36:55.112
You don't have an umbrella?

00:36:55.112 --> 00:36:57.656
Take my car. I'll give you a ride.

00:36:57.656 --> 00:37:00.300
It's okay. The bus stop is nearby.

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:04.502
You'll get soaked if you walk
to the bus stop in this heavy rain.

00:37:04.502 --> 00:37:07.149
It should stop soon, right?

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.448
Didn't you say you'd treat me to a meal?

00:37:11.448 --> 00:37:13.108
Let's do it today.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:33.809
You look like you haven't
had spicy hot pot in ages.

00:37:33.809 --> 00:37:35.961
I really haven't had it for a long time.

00:37:35.961 --> 00:37:37.880
It's hard to eat it alone.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.700
And it's weird to eat alone.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.635
You can call a friend.

00:37:43.635 --> 00:37:46.205
I've been busy with work these past few years.

00:37:46.205 --> 00:37:48.916
Besides, you can't just
ask a friend out anytime.

00:37:48.916 --> 00:37:53.031
If you ever want to eat this, you can call me.

00:37:54.358 --> 00:37:55.940
- Here's your food.
- Thank you.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.375
- I'll do it.
- Thank you.

00:38:00.669 --> 00:38:01.987
Wait.

00:38:01.987 --> 00:38:04.198
You're not going to dump
the whole plate of meat in, are you?

00:38:04.198 --> 00:38:05.557
No way.

00:38:05.557 --> 00:38:07.600
That's a capital offense.

00:38:10.909 --> 00:38:12.462
You first.

00:38:21.882 --> 00:38:25.119
Oh, good. You know your food.

00:38:27.099 --> 00:38:29.556
If you want anything else, it's on me.

00:38:29.556 --> 00:38:32.601
No, it's my treat today.

00:38:32.601 --> 00:38:35.395
An employee treating the boss
to a meal? That's embarrassing.

00:38:35.395 --> 00:38:37.439
Although I'm your employee,

00:38:37.439 --> 00:38:39.636
I'm not so poor that I can't treat you to this.

00:38:39.636 --> 00:38:41.054
I said I'd treat you.

00:38:41.054 --> 00:38:43.495
Why are you so naggy?

00:38:44.696 --> 00:38:46.807
Then I'll treat you next time.

00:38:46.807 --> 00:38:48.458
Okay.

00:39:12.182 --> 00:39:14.918
You know eight seconds is the best time.

00:39:14.918 --> 00:39:16.378
You don't talk when you're cooking.

00:39:16.378 --> 00:39:19.840
Of course. If I talk,
I get distracted and forget.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.509
But Tony always blabbers when he's cooking.

00:39:22.509 --> 00:39:24.486
He overcooks the fried dough.

00:39:24.486 --> 00:39:25.595
A capital offense.

00:39:25.595 --> 00:39:27.767
Unforgivable.

00:39:35.439 --> 00:39:37.439
Has your sleep improved?

00:39:39.067 --> 00:39:40.514
Yes.

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.494
I dreamt of you last night.

00:39:44.847 --> 00:39:46.508
You dreamt of me?

00:39:49.547 --> 00:39:52.764
I dreamt that we were walking down the street.

00:39:53.332 --> 00:39:57.008
Then we entered a motel in tandem.

00:39:57.995 --> 00:40:00.614
Once we entered the room,

00:40:00.814 --> 00:40:03.980
we couldn't wait to have each other.

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.154
You tore open my dress.

00:40:07.154 --> 00:40:09.865
I took off your shirt.

00:40:09.865 --> 00:40:12.556
I saw that you had a perfect six-pack.

00:40:13.936 --> 00:40:16.762
Then you caressed me passionately.

00:40:17.748 --> 00:40:20.442
We made love like crazy.

00:40:20.442 --> 00:40:26.056
In my dream, you had a mole there.

00:40:26.056 --> 00:40:28.027
Do you really have one?

00:40:33.959 --> 00:40:36.833
Ms. Zhou, I'll get straight to the point.

00:40:36.833 --> 00:40:40.654
During our last two sessions,
you've had some rather...

00:40:40.654 --> 00:40:43.513
explicit conversations with me.

00:40:45.083 --> 00:40:50.480
Are you trying to provoke me, or...

00:40:55.619 --> 00:40:58.001
I think...

00:40:58.727 --> 00:41:01.412
it's more like seduction.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.172
What do you think?

00:41:06.546 --> 00:41:08.760
You're the professional.

00:41:24.122 --> 00:41:26.108
Ms. Zhou.

00:41:26.108 --> 00:41:28.777
If you can't stop this behavior,

00:41:28.777 --> 00:41:34.266
I'm sorry, but I can't continue counseling you.

00:41:34.266 --> 00:41:36.209
Why's that?

00:41:37.936 --> 00:41:40.502
Is it because you have feelings for me?

00:41:43.834 --> 00:41:46.992
If you're worried about your own desires,

00:41:47.754 --> 00:41:50.998
from now on, I'm not your patient.

00:42:51.864 --> 00:42:54.644
I saw someone share online the other day

00:42:54.644 --> 00:42:58.468
that this juice combination
is very detoxifying.

00:43:44.204 --> 00:43:46.106
What are you working on?

00:43:46.106 --> 00:43:48.542
I'm drafting a retraction.

00:43:48.542 --> 00:43:49.626
What's it for?

00:43:49.626 --> 00:43:52.212
Your previous capital increase plan.

00:43:52.212 --> 00:43:53.922
Why don't you believe me?

00:43:53.922 --> 00:43:56.283
Didn't I tell you this wouldn't work?

00:43:56.283 --> 00:43:57.420
Why not?

00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:58.843
It'll be true once we make money.

00:43:58.843 --> 00:44:02.305
Once we make money,
it'll be considered fraud, you know?

00:44:02.305 --> 00:44:03.598
Please believe me.

00:44:03.598 --> 00:44:05.850
I believe that when it comes
to the capital increase plan,

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:08.186
you're clueless and don't understand.

00:44:08.186 --> 00:44:09.271
You don't know how to increase capital.

00:44:09.271 --> 00:44:10.438
I don't know?

00:44:10.438 --> 00:44:12.689
Yes, because I'm just a masseuse.

00:44:12.689 --> 00:44:13.733
I don't know anything.

00:44:13.733 --> 00:44:15.277
Do you think I ever cared about this?

00:44:15.277 --> 00:44:17.279
How can you not care?
Your actions show that you care.

00:44:17.279 --> 00:44:19.406
You don't believe in anything.

00:44:19.406 --> 00:44:21.741
I'm trying so hard to learn everything,

00:44:21.741 --> 00:44:25.036
so that I can be worthy of being with you.

00:44:25.036 --> 00:44:26.188
Can't you feel it?

00:44:26.188 --> 00:44:28.248
Fan Yue Jiao, please stop with this insecurity!

00:44:28.248 --> 00:44:30.542
I'm not insecure.

00:44:30.542 --> 00:44:32.210
I'm trying so hard.

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:35.005
If I have an inferiority complex,
don't you think it's because of you?

00:44:35.005 --> 00:44:37.340
I've been trying so hard to change everything.

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.134
Can you see it? Can you feel it?

00:44:39.134 --> 00:44:40.635
Are you in pain?

00:44:40.635 --> 00:44:42.262
- I'm not in pain. I'm working hard.
- I'm in pain.

00:44:42.262 --> 00:44:44.014
- I'm enjoying it.
- It pains me to see you like this.

00:44:44.014 --> 00:44:45.625
Why are you in pain? I can change.

00:44:45.625 --> 00:44:48.659
Maybe we should have some time apart.

00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:53.452
Time apart?

00:44:54.149 --> 00:44:55.734
Where are you going?

00:44:55.734 --> 00:44:57.736
This is your home.
Where do you want me to go?

00:44:57.736 --> 00:44:59.405
- I think we need to calm down.
- Do you want to leave me?

00:44:59.405 --> 00:45:00.190
We both need to calm down.

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:02.282
We can't reach a consensus on anything
when we communicate.

00:45:02.282 --> 00:45:03.491
I know you don't love me.

00:45:03.491 --> 00:45:05.310
If you don't love me, just say it.

00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:06.964
- You look down on me.
- We can't agree on anything.

00:45:06.964 --> 00:45:08.030
You don't love me anymore.

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:10.617
- All because I'm not worthy.
- We can't communicate well.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.793
I understand.

00:45:13.793 --> 00:45:16.780
Fan Yue Jiao, you're useless.

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.007
- Please don't think like that.
- No matter how hard you try,

00:45:18.007 --> 00:45:20.884
you're useless. No one will love you.

00:45:20.884 --> 00:45:22.202
Can we talk about the facts?

00:45:22.202 --> 00:45:24.305
- I'm telling you...
- You're not worthy.

00:45:24.305 --> 00:45:26.389
No one will love you.

00:45:26.389 --> 00:45:27.936
I have to calm down. I have to calm down.

00:45:27.936 --> 00:45:29.056
I can't get angry. I have to calm down.

00:45:29.056 --> 00:45:31.402
I can't mess up.

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:37.999
Stop holding the knife. Put it down.

00:45:40.111 --> 00:45:42.598
Don't do this again.

00:45:48.119 --> 00:45:50.528
Can you spare me, please?

00:45:59.439 --> 00:46:02.509
I'm sorry.

00:46:02.509 --> 00:46:04.963
I'm sorry.

00:46:12.352 --> 00:46:15.044
I'm sorry.

00:46:20.276 --> 00:46:22.919
I'm sorry.

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:02.226
Do you have a light?

00:50:24.988 --> 00:50:27.023
Aren't you going to return it?

00:50:27.023 --> 00:50:29.886
Now, you'll think of me when you smoke.
