kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:15.439
Newcomer

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.719
Editor-in-chief

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.000
I joined this year through campus recruitment.

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:20.719
Interstellar University, Department of Literature

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.719
Minor in history

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:28.199
You know history too.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.919
Then do you know

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:31.479
that our publishing house, historically,

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:32.759
has never had a day off?

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:35.479
No, I didn't know.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.960
Then work overtime this weekend.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.639
Get familiar with this part of history.

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:40.400
Overtime?

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.479
For what?

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:42.599
A business trip.

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:43.599
Business trip?

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:45.560
Where to?

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.520
Earth is in the Interstellar Encyclopedia Supplement

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.199
on page 1587.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.120
The entry had four views in fifty years.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.039
Including the one I contributed.

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:59.439
To update the entry,

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.599
for deeper research on Earth,

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:02.919
Ten minutes ago,

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:04.240
I was looking forward to a weekend trip.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.479
Please study with me

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.960
the must-have "Extraterrestrial Life Guidelines on Earth."

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.719
One

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:09.919
On Earth, do not casually reveal

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:11.000
your true appearance or body form.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.479
Two

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.120
Do not display your planet's special abilities.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.800
Using superpowers for profit is forbidden.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.360
Special note

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.800
Earth's magnetic field interferes

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.479
with extraterrestrial abilities.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.039
Three

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:19.080
Intermarriage is not strictly forbidden.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.759
But you must get consent in advance.

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:23.039
Interstellar travel is destined to be long,

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:24.000
exciting,

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.360
and even full of

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.319
surprises.

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:30.680
I am like a meteorite

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.639
slingshotted by gravity

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.280
to the barren edge of the Milky Way.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.199
On this dim, blue little planet,

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:38.800
my heart

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.080
is colder than cosmic microwave radiation.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.759
Nine hundred twelve days later,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.960
I got married.

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:49.280
His name is Meng Hang.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.520
He's a real estate agent.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.439
Today

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:54.840
is the day we got our marriage certificate.

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:01.199
Lili

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:03.879
The happiest thing in my life

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.159
is marrying you.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.520
But there's one last step left.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:18.240
Right.

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:19.279
This is your mom?

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.240
No.

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:21.319
You brought her out

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:22.079
for what?

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.439
Why?

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:27.160
Today is the day we got our certificate.

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:28.199
This good news

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.279
we have to tell her.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.079
Yes.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.360
How do we tell her?

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:36.319
Just use

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.000
the most traditional way.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.639
Then I will

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.040
do what?

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:52.480
This...

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.680
Burn it for her.

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:55.600
No need to be that traditional.

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:57.000
Burn?

00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:58.040
We have to burn this too.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.360
Here.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.920
Mom

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.319
Lili and I got our certificate.

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:24.600
My biggest regret

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:26.319
is that you're gone.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.439
I wish so much

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.079
Lili and I could tell you

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:31.360
this good news in person.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.800
You talk to mom first.

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:35.360
Me?

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:36.399
Say something?

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.160
Hello, you are...

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.959
Here...

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:52.319
Is this Li Lili?

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.120
Who is it?

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:57.480
Wh-what's going on?

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.040
What's wrong, Meng Hang?

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:01.000
Meng Hang

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.519
What's up with you?

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:06.800
Oh mom!

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.360
What's wrong with him?

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.399
Why did he look at me

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:24.800
like he'd seen a ghost?

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.279
Mom, why are you here?

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.519
Go ahead, say it.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.720
How did I disappear?

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:41.360
I never thought my mom would come to Earth.

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:45.480
Earthlings are all born from their mothers.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.439
I'm not.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.879
I was taken from an artificial womb.

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:51.279
Like taking a meal out of a microwave.

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:53.879
The only difference between me and a boxed meal

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.360
is that a meal satisfies hunger,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.839
but raising me

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.199
was just my mom's duty.

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:02.480
S-Star People have no emotions.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.319
Her sudden visit

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.000
didn't bring motherly love,

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.600
but trouble.

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:09.560
I don't know.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.680
What the heck is this?

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:12.319
The photo was brought out.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.399
Incense was lit.

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:18.160
I'm married.

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:19.439
Meng Hang and I

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.720
Shouldn't you meet the parents when you marry?

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.199
I thought for such a small thing,

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.639
well,

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:28.519
I wouldn't trouble you.

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:31.480
You came to Earth

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.720
for a business trip, right?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.480
How did you end up marrying an Earthling?

00:07:36.079 --> 00:07:38.079
People from the home planet have no emotions.

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:40.519
How do I explain to my mom

00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:42.319
my relationship with Meng Hang?

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.600
In recent years,

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.959
extreme weather events have ravaged the world.

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:46.759
Data shows

00:07:47.079 --> 00:07:49.920
2024 is the hottest year on record.

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:51.120
Earth's temperature is rising,

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.879
causing 84% of coral to bleach.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.519
Eighty percent of coral

00:07:58.319 --> 00:07:58.879
See?

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:00.920
With Earth like this,

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:03.519
is it even necessary to update the data?

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:04.680
Keep your voice down.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.439
It's not just aliens here.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.920
Earthlings come too.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.199
Don't blow your cover.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.839
A business trip for two and a half years.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.560
I was about to get a permanent position.

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:15.720
Now that's out of reach.

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:24.800
That's what our editor-in-chief said.

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:27.199
Earth has changed a lot

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:29.399
in the past few years.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.920
You have to stay there longer

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.440
to complete a deeper investigation.

00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:35.720
When you return,

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:38.080
you'll be promoted to senior editor right away.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.360
Whether you get the position

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.440
or a raise

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.919
all depends on your performance.

00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:47.159
Do you know what his behavior

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:48.720
is called on Earth?

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.679
Mental manipulation.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.399
People like me

00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:53.720
on Earth

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.159
are called corporate slaves.

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:57.159
Not even considered human.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.519
What's so great about him?

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:00.600
Yeah.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.919
What's so special about him?

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.679
He's just a boss.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:10.559
Right.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.360
The kind who just sits in the office all day

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.559
and does nothing.

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:17.240
As long as the boss says a word,

00:09:17.559 --> 00:09:19.679
we have to run ourselves ragged.

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:30.759
Cheers!

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.639
Um...

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.879
Right now,

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:43.200
about the "jerk" group,

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:45.080
I don't fully understand them.

00:09:45.559 --> 00:09:47.399
Can you give me some material

00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:49.399
and talk about your thoughts and feelings?

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.519
I'm not a jerk.

00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:57.159
If you're not a jerk, then what are you?

00:09:57.519 --> 00:10:00.000
I saw that girl splash water on you just now.

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:00.960
What am I?

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.240
Doesn't matter.

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:04.480
But I know

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.840
what you are.

00:10:08.679 --> 00:10:09.679
What am I?

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.000
You're from another galaxy,

00:10:16.519 --> 00:10:18.279
sent to Earth

00:10:22.159 --> 00:10:23.159
as an angel.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.399
That's how we got together.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.440
Your quick marriage

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.559
was faster than lightning.

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:32.279
That was just how we met.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.480
We went through a lot together after that.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.200
Like what?

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:40.080
For example...

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:41.840
Well then,

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:42.679
Goodbye.

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:43.919
Goodbye.

00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:51.919
Meng Hang.

00:10:54.159 --> 00:10:54.679
Lili.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.320
They say

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.120
with their current trajectories,

00:10:59.559 --> 00:11:01.320
the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.960
will collide in four billion years

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:03.840
and crash together,

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:05.200
merging into one.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.799
Right now, Meng Hang and I

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.399
are drawn to each other,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.600
colliding,

00:11:19.159 --> 00:11:21.000
becoming each other's

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:22.200
companion star.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:28.759
You...

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.679
Are you okay?

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:30.720
You...

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:31.720
You're crushing my arm.

00:11:34.919 --> 00:11:36.399
I think my leg's broken too.

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:37.720
Leg...

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:38.600
So...

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.440
Is it that bad?

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.600
It's fine.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.480
Just both hands broken.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.360
You scared me to death.

00:11:45.399 --> 00:11:46.840
I thought you were a goner.

00:11:48.799 --> 00:11:50.159
That's still a fracture.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.559
You're like a pharaoh now.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.519
Sorry to trouble you.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.480
Help me get my phone.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.679
Unlock it.

00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:06.399
Open your eyes.

00:12:10.799 --> 00:12:11.440
Put it in my hand.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.679
I'll type a few words.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.039
You're in this state,

00:12:16.039 --> 00:12:16.679
don't bother typing.

00:12:16.679 --> 00:12:17.559
Just send a voice message.

00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:22.720
Social anxiety.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.799
So what do you want to say?

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.679
I'll type it for you.

00:12:34.919 --> 00:12:35.639
Meng Hang,

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.799
can you show the apartment tomorrow?

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:38.919
Tell her

00:12:39.159 --> 00:12:39.879
I'm in the hospital.

00:12:40.279 --> 00:12:41.919
I won't be discharged
for another two weeks.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.360
That's it.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:46.759
Meng Hang,

00:12:46.919 --> 00:12:48.279
the security here is terrible.

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:50.200
A group just tried to take my place.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.679
I was too scared to open the door.

00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:53.120
Uncle Zhang,

00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:55.080
please open the door and check.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.879
It's the prosecutor's office outside.

00:12:57.039 --> 00:12:58.480
Just pay back the money,
and it's fine.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.200
This time is much better.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.120
Way better than last time.

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:07.000
By the way, Meng,

00:13:07.399 --> 00:13:08.840
my girlfriend insists on getting a cat.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.320
Can you ask the landlord
if pets are allowed?

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.200
I asked the landlord.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.080
He said it's allowed.

00:13:13.799 --> 00:13:14.600
Then I won't rent it.

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:16.200
Please help me find another one.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:16.879
One that doesn't allow pets.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.320
It's still that person.

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:21.320
Asking if you can show the place today.

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:22.679
Bro,

00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:24.279
I'm in the hospital.

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:26.279
Can we do another day?

00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:31.120
Meng Hang,

00:13:31.159 --> 00:13:32.120
can you show the apartment today?

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.519
I've said it three times already.

00:13:33.519 --> 00:13:34.600
Why are you pretending not to hear?

00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:37.080
I told you, I'm hospitalized.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.600
Do you not understand Mandarin?

00:13:38.879 --> 00:13:39.519
Still want to see the place?

00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:41.279
Check if the hospital has a room first.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.279
I'm so pissed off.

00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:44.159
That's rude to talk to a client like that.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.960
He's not your client anymore.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:53.960
Meng Hang,

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.720
I've talked to the boss.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.919
Stop bothering your clients.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.279
I've taken over.

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:00.080
Also,

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.039
send me those two key clients'
WeChat contacts.

00:14:02.039 --> 00:14:03.240
Don't forget to forward them.

00:14:03.919 --> 00:14:05.159
Just focus on getting better.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.039
I really miss you.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.159
If you miss me,

00:14:10.159 --> 00:14:11.759
come see me in person.

00:14:11.919 --> 00:14:13.440
Say it to my face.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.440
Your legs aren't broken.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.559
It's been two months.

00:14:21.759 --> 00:14:23.679
Why haven't you sold my place yet?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.360
I've lost two months' rent.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.320
You need to make up for it.

00:14:26.919 --> 00:14:28.639
Didn't expect you to be so incompetent.

00:14:28.879 --> 00:14:30.000
If this keeps up, I'll find someone else.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.679
My place is easy to sell.

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:34.120
Yeah.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.440
Your place

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.879
is really easy to flip.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.039
Within our agency,

00:14:38.039 --> 00:14:39.240
it's changed hands seven or eight times.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.200
No one wants to sell it.

00:14:42.039 --> 00:14:43.919
Meng Hang, why can't you come?

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.639
It's just a fracture, right?

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.360
Get a wheelchair and come over.

00:14:49.399 --> 00:14:50.840
Fine, fine.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.879
Put four wheels on the place

00:14:52.879 --> 00:14:53.600
and push it to the hospital.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.360
I'll view it with you right now.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.039
What kind of people are these?

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:56.919
They're nuts.

00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:04.480
Did I wake you up?

00:15:05.399 --> 00:15:05.879
No.

00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:08.720
What you just said

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.559
I could never say in my life.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.240
But it felt great to hear.

00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:14.600
It's nothing.

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:15.559
You should say it too.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.399
When you get unreasonable demands,

00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:18.399
you have to push back.

00:15:19.879 --> 00:15:21.399
But I can't say it out loud.

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:22.879
If you can't say it,

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.440
just think it in your head.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.000
Think it in your head.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:34.759
Meng Hang,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.960
the landlord gave me the keys.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.159
Help me move this weekend.

00:15:40.879 --> 00:15:42.759
How are you so shameless?

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.919
I'll owe you this time.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.320
When you move your ancestors' grave,

00:15:48.679 --> 00:15:50.519
I'll definitely be there.

00:15:54.279 --> 00:15:54.879
I did it.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.279
I did it.

00:15:56.559 --> 00:15:58.080
I did it.

00:15:58.639 --> 00:15:59.759
I did it.

00:16:00.279 --> 00:16:01.080
I did it.

00:16:01.679 --> 00:16:02.320
I did it.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:03.919
I'm ready.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:04.639
Go ahead.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:05.360
I can say it.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:05.919
Talk back to him.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:06.519
Talk back to him.

00:16:06.559 --> 00:16:07.039
Start.

00:16:07.159 --> 00:16:07.639
Talk back to him.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.879
Listen up.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:11.759
Your face—

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:13.399
Your face—

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.440
Face.

00:16:17.759 --> 00:16:18.159
Bro,

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.679
I'll go tomorrow.

00:16:20.159 --> 00:16:21.080
Sorry about that.

00:16:21.159 --> 00:16:22.080
Sorry, sorry.

00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:25.399
Why did you hold it back again?

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:28.440
It's fine.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.000
I vented in my mind anyway.

00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:33.000
True.

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:34.879
I still love hearing you talk back.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.320
When you talk back,

00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:38.440
it feels like

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.879
getting a full massage inside.

00:16:40.679 --> 00:16:42.279
It's so relaxing.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.759
I'm serious.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:45.840
I think

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.120
I'm really happy with you.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:49.879
Especially your

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.399
pure

00:16:51.879 --> 00:16:53.240
and fun vibe.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.679
I really like—

00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:01.720
Wash a banana and eat it.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.960
Or maybe an orange.

00:17:06.279 --> 00:17:07.000
That works too.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:13.680
That's my confession.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.000
Pretty much.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.000
But this is just—

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.440
I'm really winging it here.

00:17:20.799 --> 00:17:22.039
The two of us—

00:17:22.039 --> 00:17:24.440
we truly love each other.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:27.640
So that means

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.440
you're not planning to go home?

00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:33.839
I haven't thought that far yet.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.200
Interplanetary marriages
are common now.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.119
Me

00:17:44.279 --> 00:17:45.200
Let me ask you one last thing.

00:17:45.759 --> 00:17:46.599
Are you

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.680
planning not to return to the home planet?

00:17:52.599 --> 00:17:53.319
It's a deal.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.240
You have to keep your word.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.160
That's great!

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.079
I'm finally free.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:56.920
I'm liberated now.

00:17:57.039 --> 00:17:58.240
I've finally made it through.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.759
Don't you think, in these two years on Earth,

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.960
I've looked much healthier?

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.039
Mom,

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.480
Emotional indifference is our planet's trait.

00:18:09.759 --> 00:18:11.519
So while you're annoyed by me,

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.440
I'm also annoyed by you.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.319
Fine.

00:18:16.359 --> 00:18:17.640
Let's cut ties.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.119
Deal.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.720
Take care, I won't see you off.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.799
Actually,

00:18:26.799 --> 00:18:28.799
I did come to you for something.

00:18:31.599 --> 00:18:32.599
Well, I

00:18:32.839 --> 00:18:34.160
was planning to go

00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:36.519
travel in Canes Venatici.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.039
But then,

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.079
passing by

00:18:39.279 --> 00:18:40.680
the Earth service station,

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.119
I got off to stretch my legs.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.640
Had a cup of coffee,

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.079
and used the restroom.

00:18:45.079 --> 00:18:46.759
Then I wandered around for a bit.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.079
When I looked up,

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.200
the spaceship was gone.

00:18:51.039 --> 00:18:53.680
It left me on Earth and took off.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.400
I quickly called the travel agency.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:58.759
They said

00:18:59.279 --> 00:19:02.319
I could take the next spaceship out.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.240
Honestly,

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.240
I'm just saying,

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.519
your habit of dawdling

00:19:06.519 --> 00:19:08.000
has delayed so many things.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.160
I've told you since you were little,

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:16.160
I've always told you,

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.839
don't dawdle, don't dawdle.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:18.920
But you never listen.

00:19:19.319 --> 00:19:20.599
You should hurry and leave.

00:19:20.599 --> 00:19:22.240
Or you'll miss the next one too.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.640
I do want to leave,

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.319
but the next one

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.319
is in half a year.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.359
So you

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.680
What do you mean?

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.079
Where am I supposed to live for six months?

00:19:40.039 --> 00:19:40.880
How would I know?

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.279
Live wherever you want.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.680
We're mother and daughter.

00:19:45.119 --> 00:19:46.720
Shouldn't you show some hospitality?

00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:47.759
Ms. Cai,

00:19:48.319 --> 00:19:50.200
we just cut ties, remember?

00:19:50.839 --> 00:19:51.559
Ms. Li,

00:19:51.839 --> 00:19:52.759
then give me money.

00:19:52.799 --> 00:19:53.720
I'll stay at a hotel.

00:19:54.559 --> 00:19:56.839
You travel without bringing money?

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.720
I have plenty of money in my bag.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.400
Then spend it.

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:02.000
My bag is on the spaceship.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.720
I don't have any money now.

00:20:06.759 --> 00:20:07.559
That's not my problem.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.839
I'm just a worker.

00:20:11.359 --> 00:20:13.000
Earning a salary from the home planet,

00:20:13.119 --> 00:20:14.640
making extra money on Earth,

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.119
and you say you have no money?

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.400
Didn't I just say

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.680
I'm just a worker?

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.319
I work part-time,

00:20:19.319 --> 00:20:20.680
how much can I really make?

00:20:20.839 --> 00:20:22.559
Isn't working for money?

00:20:22.599 --> 00:20:23.880
Are you a sucker, working for nothing?

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.880
I'm doing it for in-depth research.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:26.960
on Earthlings' lives.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.559
That's my job, you know?

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:30.640
If you need money,

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.519
get a job yourself.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.920
Wait, how did you find your job?

00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:35.960
Me?

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.400
I'm from Interstellar University's literature department.

00:20:46.759 --> 00:20:47.880
My new assistant just arrived.

00:20:48.599 --> 00:20:49.640
Boss, I'm here!

00:20:51.319 --> 00:20:52.079
Um,

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.680
draft something for me.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.079
Okay.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:56.920
After using the restroom,

00:20:57.039 --> 00:20:58.200
please flush immediately.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.440
Add three exclamation marks.

00:20:59.559 --> 00:21:00.400
Post it in the restroom.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.279
Got it!

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:05.359
Xiao Li,

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:06.400
Sis,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.160
Soon, the designer, client,

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.079
and the renovation foreman

00:21:09.079 --> 00:21:10.160
will meet in the conference room.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.160
Go buy some fruit.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.160
Sis,

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.200
the boss just asked me to write a document.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:16.920
Who do you listen to at work?

00:21:18.359 --> 00:21:19.880
I'm the boss's assistant.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.119
When the boss goes home,

00:21:21.119 --> 00:21:22.559
I'm her assistant.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.000
No, sis,

00:21:24.799 --> 00:21:27.200
this isn't in my job description.

00:21:27.359 --> 00:21:28.359
Have you ever worked before?

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.240
Every extra task you're given

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.200
is training for you.

00:21:31.319 --> 00:21:31.880
Go now.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.119
But sis, then

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.799
on Earth,

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.599
are all young people like this?

00:21:38.319 --> 00:21:39.279
Of course.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.279
Alright.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.359
I'll go buy it now.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:43.559
Go ahead.

00:21:44.559 --> 00:21:46.319
Earth's young people are so driven.

00:21:53.599 --> 00:21:55.200
They sure have a lot to do.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:56.880
So,

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.240
how much do they earn?

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.160
You guessed it.

00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:01.880
Even though there's a lot to do,

00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:03.039
the salary

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:03.920
isn't much.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.720
That's how young Earthlings are now.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.599
Planet's customs,

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:11.400
respect,

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.000
and blessings.

00:22:13.359 --> 00:22:15.319
So why do you work here?

00:22:15.559 --> 00:22:17.000
For my in-depth research.

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:18.720
How else can I research without working?

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.599
Did you get married for research too?

00:22:20.599 --> 00:22:21.839
Of course not.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.480
I and...

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.680
Untie him first.

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:26.960
Doesn't matter.

00:22:28.279 --> 00:22:29.279
Hurry up.

00:22:41.599 --> 00:22:43.279
What kind of thing did you find?

00:22:49.599 --> 00:22:50.559
Meng Hang,

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.599
it's all a misunderstanding.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.559
Look.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:54.920
I really am

00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:56.400
just a living person.

00:22:59.799 --> 00:23:00.559
A real, living person.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:03.880
Doorway.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:05.480
Table.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:06.720
Eyes.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.000
A real, living person.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.839
No, there isn't.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.279
Maybe you saw wrong.

00:23:18.039 --> 00:23:18.880
Meng Hang.

00:23:19.119 --> 00:23:21.400
Have you been working too hard lately?

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.960
Are you seeing things?

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.200
I saw wrong.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:29.440
Yeah.

00:23:30.319 --> 00:23:31.240
Maybe I'm just too tired.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:32.680
Too tired.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.039
Auntie—no,

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:36.680
Mom.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.039
Sorry.

00:23:38.039 --> 00:23:39.160
Sorry to make you laugh at me.

00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:41.440
Didn't Lili say

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.640
you were gone?

00:23:44.079 --> 00:23:44.599
What should I do?

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.400
Let me think.

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:49.839
Let me think.

00:23:50.119 --> 00:23:52.359
Thinking of that Korean drama I watched.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.599
I got it.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.839
Just say

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.039
you had a terminal illness.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.559
But you didn't want to burden me.

00:23:59.759 --> 00:24:01.119
So you lied and said you were gone.

00:24:01.519 --> 00:24:02.359
But your illness

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.359
miraculously got cured.

00:24:12.359 --> 00:24:13.680
What illness did you have?

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.079
Late-stage cancer.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.519
You even beat late-stage cancer.

00:24:24.279 --> 00:24:25.680
What happens next in the drama?

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.319
You're off script.

00:24:27.319 --> 00:24:28.559
That wasn't in the original.

00:24:29.119 --> 00:24:30.680
You can't even copy it right.

00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:36.599
Misdiagnosis.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.039
So Mom, you came from your hometown?

00:24:40.519 --> 00:24:41.440
Where's my hometown?

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:42.960
Tieling.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:44.839
Right.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:45.720
Came from hometown.

00:24:45.839 --> 00:24:46.279
Tieling.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.640
You must've gotten a flight discount, right?

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.359
Which route did you fly before?

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.160
What do you mean?

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:56.079
You used to be a flight attendant.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.799
Then you trained flight attendants.

00:24:58.079 --> 00:24:59.119
At Tieling Airlines.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.119
Flew everywhere.

00:25:04.519 --> 00:25:05.079
Hold on.

00:25:05.119 --> 00:25:06.240
This kind of talk is exhausting.

00:25:06.319 --> 00:25:07.279
Just tell me everything.

00:25:07.519 --> 00:25:09.039
What else did you make up?

00:25:11.079 --> 00:25:12.359
Nothing else.

00:25:14.599 --> 00:25:15.279
There's one thing.

00:25:15.559 --> 00:25:16.400
It's really important.

00:25:17.119 --> 00:25:18.799
I said we have a deep bond.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.759
We're really close.

00:25:23.519 --> 00:25:25.559
Why make up these lies?

00:25:25.799 --> 00:25:27.279
You might as well say I'm dead.

00:25:27.279 --> 00:25:28.759
I did say you were dead.

00:25:28.759 --> 00:25:30.240
Who knew you'd show up again?

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.279
Earthlings all like

00:25:32.279 --> 00:25:33.480
filial girls.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.519
You're filial?

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.920
You're a joke.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.000
See? Look, look.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:37.839
I knew you'd be like this.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.119
You never cooperate with me.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.480
Just leave already.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.559
If you want to kick me out,

00:25:43.599 --> 00:25:44.960
I'll tell Meng Hang.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.240
Then call the police.

00:25:46.279 --> 00:25:47.839
Say you're a scammer.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.400
What did I scam?

00:25:49.599 --> 00:25:50.880
You're an alien.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.160
I'm an alien.

00:25:54.279 --> 00:25:55.559
But you're my mom.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.880
At most, I'm an accomplice.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.279
You're the main culprit.

00:25:58.839 --> 00:25:59.640
I'll cook, I'll cook.

00:26:00.079 --> 00:26:01.119
Don't let Mom cook.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.440
You're hungry, right?

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.359
I'll go cook.

00:26:10.359 --> 00:26:11.519
I didn't use my powers.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.359
My powers are weaker on Earth.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.799
You're really not leaving?

00:26:20.559 --> 00:26:21.920
I have no money,

00:26:22.079 --> 00:26:23.079
no house,

00:26:23.319 --> 00:26:26.200
just a homeless alien in a strange land.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.640
Where do you want me to go?

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.640
Go ask at a mental hospital.

00:26:32.079 --> 00:26:33.319
Just say you're an alien.

00:26:33.359 --> 00:26:34.119
Down on your luck.

00:26:34.279 --> 00:26:35.319
Maybe they'll take you in.

00:26:35.799 --> 00:26:37.000
An alien, right?

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.920
Meng Hang, let me tell you something.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.839
Don't pull this on me.

00:26:50.039 --> 00:26:50.799
No.

00:26:51.119 --> 00:26:52.160
It's not up to me.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.839
This is Meng Hang's house.

00:26:54.039 --> 00:26:55.400
He has to agree, right?

00:26:56.319 --> 00:26:57.680
If you say yes, it's yes.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.200
He's easy to deal with.

00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:03.079
I have one condition.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.519
No using superpowers.

00:27:09.839 --> 00:27:11.920
Why does your mom seem so hard to get along with?

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.279
She's really hard to get along with.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.480
Watch what you say.

00:27:16.559 --> 00:27:17.319
Don't provoke her.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:26.599
Meng Hang,

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.119
sit down.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.200
What do you do for work?

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.279
I work in real estate, consumer-facing.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.480
A marketing company.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.359
I'm currently a senior manager.

00:27:41.359 --> 00:27:42.039
Our

00:27:42.519 --> 00:27:43.240
department

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.960
has a monthly turnover

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:46.799
of

00:27:47.039 --> 00:27:48.000
about one hundred million.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.759
But

00:27:52.039 --> 00:27:53.920
for Lili to have a better life,

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.559
I'll keep working hard.

00:27:58.119 --> 00:27:59.519
That's a big business.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.160
Yes.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.440
She didn't even ask who I am.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.240
The boss really does big business.

00:28:05.599 --> 00:28:06.400
Must make a lot of money.

00:28:08.119 --> 00:28:09.039
A hundred million

00:28:09.039 --> 00:28:10.279
is just a few zeros away.

00:28:11.559 --> 00:28:13.759
Mother-in-law's too picky, can't be honest.

00:28:14.319 --> 00:28:15.640
Your father is pretty good, right?

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:20.960
Yes.

00:28:21.559 --> 00:28:22.960
My dad used to be an intellectual.

00:28:24.079 --> 00:28:24.880
Then he went into business.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.039
Now he gives lectures at university.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.359
My dad can't be honest either.

00:28:31.799 --> 00:28:32.440
My dad,

00:28:33.039 --> 00:28:34.759
often goes to university to give talks.

00:28:36.119 --> 00:28:37.720
Based on my careful analysis,

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.799
and thorough research,

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.000
when you're fifty-two,

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.240
you'll face a calamity.

00:28:45.279 --> 00:28:45.799
Old Meng,

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.000
that's really accurate.

00:28:47.039 --> 00:28:47.400
Right?

00:28:47.599 --> 00:28:49.039
My spouse passed away that year.

00:28:49.119 --> 00:28:49.440
Really?

00:28:50.319 --> 00:28:51.359
Can you check for me too?

00:28:51.359 --> 00:28:52.680
See when my spouse will pass.

00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:54.640
Why are you hoping for that?

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.240
Just check for me quickly.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:55.880
Seriously.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:56.759
Help me check, hurry.

00:28:56.759 --> 00:28:57.440
No rush.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.000
No rush, everyone gets a turn.

00:28:59.319 --> 00:29:00.240
Then you'll be fine.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.680
You'll have a second spring.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:02.920
All good, right?

00:29:03.359 --> 00:29:03.759
Isn't it?

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.480
Is it accurate?

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.839
His lectures are loved by students.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.480
Want just one.

00:29:13.599 --> 00:29:14.039
Brother,

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.400
let me borrow this spot.

00:29:15.599 --> 00:29:17.359
He likes music.

00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:18.920
Mainly classical.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.680
Your drumming is off.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:21.839
Your rhythm is wrong.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.519
Don't hold back, you need to commit.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.599
A song, "Flowers," for everyone.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.079
One, two, ready to go.

00:29:27.519 --> 00:29:29.759
Oh, my heart.

00:29:29.799 --> 00:29:31.839
Oh, my heart.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.160
Whole building for rent.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.039
That's him.

00:29:34.359 --> 00:29:35.480
That's him, that's him.

00:29:36.039 --> 00:29:37.160
No outsiders allowed on stage here.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:37.359
I

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.039
just want to sing one song.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.799
I was pulled down halfway through.

00:29:39.799 --> 00:29:41.000
He even held a concert.

00:29:41.559 --> 00:29:43.240
It was really lively then.

00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:47.880
My dad now runs

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.400
a large pet supply store.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.960
He loves animals.

00:29:51.599 --> 00:29:52.079
You're kind of

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:52.880
a bit

00:29:53.079 --> 00:29:53.960
getting in my way, come on.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.079
Come, come down here.

00:29:55.599 --> 00:29:56.000
Come.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.039
And you?

00:29:57.519 --> 00:29:58.839
Check your phone here.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.599
I'll help you test this new product.

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:09.559
Old Meng,

00:30:11.839 --> 00:30:13.440
Did you dump pet poop

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.880
into the greenbelt secretly?

00:30:16.799 --> 00:30:18.119
You're funny.

00:30:18.319 --> 00:30:19.160
So many dog owners,

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.119
but you target me.

00:30:20.759 --> 00:30:22.079
That's alpaca poop.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.400
Just because of this,

00:30:26.799 --> 00:30:27.720
the inspection failed.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.680
It affects the district's rating.

00:30:31.519 --> 00:30:32.160
What's wrong with you?

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:32.960
You go anywhere you want.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:33.920
You're too much.

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:35.559
I scolded it.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.119
I'm telling you,

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.920
if things go wrong, it's all on you.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.000
It's bad for the environment.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:40.839
My dad's store

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.039
is well-known in the district.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.000
That's truly respected.

00:30:49.079 --> 00:30:50.319
Lili has a father-in-law like this,

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.079
that's

00:30:51.119 --> 00:30:52.200
her good fortune.

00:30:53.079 --> 00:30:53.480
Yes.

00:30:55.759 --> 00:30:56.480
Thank you, thank you.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:03.119
Eat.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.200
Take what you like, eat anything.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:05.880
Don't be shy.

00:31:08.359 --> 00:31:09.359
It's so late.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.519
I should get going.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.640
I came in a rush.

00:31:13.799 --> 00:31:14.799
Forgot to book a hotel.

00:31:15.759 --> 00:31:17.000
Not sure if there are any rooms left.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.279
If not,

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.480
the lobby

00:31:19.599 --> 00:31:21.079
not sure if sleeping there is allowed.

00:31:22.319 --> 00:31:22.920
Mom,

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.799
You should've said earlier.

00:31:25.559 --> 00:31:26.279
Then you should

00:31:27.599 --> 00:31:28.880
quickly grab a good spot.

00:31:29.039 --> 00:31:29.920
Stay away from the main door.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:30.599
Don't catch a draft.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:31.759
Mom,

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.400
Just stay here.

00:31:33.519 --> 00:31:33.960
Okay.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.279
You're home now.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.079
Why stay at a hotel?

00:31:37.319 --> 00:31:39.640
Is this tiny room livable?

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
I'll take this room.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.359
That's our master bedroom.

00:31:48.599 --> 00:31:50.319
This is our room.

00:31:50.359 --> 00:31:51.440
Our master bedroom.

00:31:52.079 --> 00:31:52.799
It's fine.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.519
Fine for what?

00:31:56.119 --> 00:31:57.079
If she stays here,

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.359
shouldn't you discuss with your dad?

00:31:59.519 --> 00:32:00.680
He's alone too.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.720
My mom joins us, now we're three.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.000
Will he be happy about that?

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.640
My dad,

00:32:08.039 --> 00:32:09.359
I'll talk to him myself.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:11.839
Pet store.

00:32:11.839 --> 00:32:12.839
I know where it is.

00:32:22.559 --> 00:32:23.319
Done.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.640
Meng Hang's dad agreed.

00:32:26.279 --> 00:32:27.039
He agreed.

00:32:27.759 --> 00:32:28.519
You don't believe it?

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:29.720
He's about to...

00:32:30.599 --> 00:32:31.400
You're back.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.559
Meng Hang, your dad's back.

00:32:35.119 --> 00:32:35.880
Why are you here?

00:32:36.759 --> 00:32:38.279
Watch your words.

00:32:38.599 --> 00:32:40.039
Can't your own dad come?

00:32:42.599 --> 00:32:43.759
He's not my dad.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:51.559
Old Gao.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.160
What's wrong, Old Meng?

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.640
The pipe broke, can't use the toilet.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:55.720
My stomach feels off.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:56.319
Can you check for me?

00:32:56.319 --> 00:32:57.079
Alright, go do your thing.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:57.640
Okay, okay, okay.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.359
Take your time in there.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.079
Thanks.

00:33:20.079 --> 00:33:20.720
You.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:21.759
What would you like?

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:24.519
You.

00:33:25.279 --> 00:33:25.960
Me.

00:33:28.559 --> 00:33:28.920
You.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Didn't you say you'd come to my place?

00:33:34.039 --> 00:33:35.119
I'm here to pick you up.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.359
My place is really spacious.

00:33:36.359 --> 00:33:37.240
It's just me there.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:37.720
And also...

00:33:37.799 --> 00:33:38.759
If the two of us are in...

00:33:46.519 --> 00:33:47.519
this neighborhood...

00:33:47.519 --> 00:33:49.640
There are a few pet stores.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.440
How could you still get it wrong?

00:33:54.559 --> 00:33:55.039
What's with the "ow"?

00:33:55.839 --> 00:33:57.279
You don't watch where you're going?

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.119
If you did, would I bump into you?

00:33:59.319 --> 00:34:00.359
Are your eyes working as ears now?

00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:02.000
Yeah.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.279
I was busy looking at people.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.240
Didn't notice you.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.640
Haven't seen you in the yard.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.679
You're new here, right?

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.679
Which yard?

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.760
The mental hospital.

00:34:11.559 --> 00:34:12.280
With your condition...

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.239
You should go to the clinic.

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:15.400
Get a rabies shot.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.039
Catch.

00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:22.960
Who bites whom?

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:24.840
Bite whoever you catch.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:27.840
Used it too much before.

00:34:28.079 --> 00:34:29.239
Lost some power.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.360
Couldn't hold it.

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:34.840
You keep touching me.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:35.760
I'm warning you.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.599
I trained Wing Chun at Shaolin.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:38.679
If you touch me...

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.079
Touch me and you'll get hurt.

00:34:40.079 --> 00:34:40.679
Go ahead, try.

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:41.000
You.

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:42.360
Stop messing around.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:43.440
Annoying.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.280
You pulled my hair.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.719
A man's hairstyle is crucial.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:46.599
Don't—don't leave.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.079
You.

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:49.360
Lunatic.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:50.920
Total lunatic.

00:34:54.079 --> 00:34:55.000
Just ran into a lunatic.

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:56.119
Kept touching me.

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:57.079
Even pulled my hair.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.639
You got into another fight outside?

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.039
She started it.

00:35:00.199 --> 00:35:01.159
Let me be clear first.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.800
If her parents come, it's not my problem.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.440
I take responsibility for my actions.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.960
If she comes, she won't leave this room.

00:35:08.559 --> 00:35:09.079
You.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.199
Why are you looking for me?

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:13.960
Lili's mom is here.

00:35:15.199 --> 00:35:16.000
Mother-in-law.

00:35:19.199 --> 00:35:20.639
Wasn't she gone?

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.679
It's a long story.

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:24.199
Anyway...

00:35:25.639 --> 00:35:26.639
She's alive again.

00:35:28.719 --> 00:35:30.400
Look at her physique.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:35.599
Her mom will be here soon.

00:35:35.719 --> 00:35:37.199
Let's tidy up first.

00:35:37.599 --> 00:35:39.400
Why bother? I'm fine as is.

00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:40.199
Remember this.

00:35:40.199 --> 00:35:41.239
Your current identity...

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.199
is an international business owner...

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.519
and a university professor.

00:35:45.519 --> 00:35:47.400
Sounds like a pyramid scheme.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.000
Go inside and change.

00:35:53.119 --> 00:35:54.039
Is that necessary?

00:35:54.079 --> 00:35:54.679
Come on, come on.

00:36:04.599 --> 00:36:05.960
Couldn't find Meng Hang's dad.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:07.880
Ran into a lunatic.

00:36:08.559 --> 00:36:09.760
His dad's already back.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:10.880
Really?

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:12.599
Where is he?

00:36:13.199 --> 00:36:14.199
About me living here...

00:36:14.199 --> 00:36:14.960
Does he know?

00:36:15.559 --> 00:36:16.000
Mom.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:17.679
I...

00:36:18.199 --> 00:36:19.079
My dad's here.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.559
As an alien drifting on Earth...

00:36:48.559 --> 00:36:49.840
I'm actually pretty lucky.

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.199
I've only been here two years.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.320
I found a job.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.440
And a husband.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.800
Advice for young people...

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.480
There's not much to say.

00:36:57.559 --> 00:36:59.800
Just keep a fighting spirit.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.960
If things get too tough...

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:02.880
Just write a report.

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.159
Suggest dimensional reduction for Earth.

00:37:04.239 --> 00:37:05.360
Then I'll return to my home planet.

00:37:06.159 --> 00:37:08.000
The key is to stay calm.

00:37:08.639 --> 00:37:09.840
Why did I get married?

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.119
Of course, because I love Meng Hang.

00:37:12.159 --> 00:37:13.000
Here on Earth...

00:37:13.039 --> 00:37:14.079
There's no other answer.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.519
Why Meng Hang?

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:20.920
The two of us...

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.119
are like puzzle pieces.

00:37:22.119 --> 00:37:24.039
We're not perfect.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.679
But for each other...

00:37:25.679 --> 00:37:27.000
we're the best fit.

00:37:27.559 --> 00:37:28.280
Of course.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.960
Marriage has its risks.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.159
But if it fails...

00:37:31.159 --> 00:37:32.400
there's nothing to be ashamed of.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.599
Worst case, just reduce Earth's dimension.

00:37:34.599 --> 00:37:35.320
Go back to my home planet.

00:37:36.559 --> 00:37:37.840
Stay calm, always.
