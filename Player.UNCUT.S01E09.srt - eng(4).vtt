- (Previously on "Player")
- Can we move our flight to Hong Kong tomorrow?

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.280
I’ve transferred the money back to you.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.440
Once you’re done with me,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.880
stop getting Ploy involved in your mess.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.920
“Didn’t Ploy go to Hong Kong with you, Pun?”

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.320
Didn’t you drop her off
at the condo this morning?

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.320
I’ll tell you when I get back.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.640
I’m in a hurry right now.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.680
Why did you do this,?

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.960
I’m not worried about the money.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I’m worried about you.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.600
Just stop messing with me already.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.760
You and Dad...

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.880
have never expected anything
from me anyway.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.800
Pun. You’re travelling around here too?

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.320
How did she even get here?

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.680
But this trip was supposed to be ours.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.640
You mean the trip you refused to come on?

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.680
How could you do this to me?

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.640
What about you?

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.000
Which guy did you ditch me for, Pun?

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.680
- I just had to...
- Had to what?

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.560
If you’ve found someone else, that’s fine.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.360
At least then I’d know
neither of us ever really meant it.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.640
"Fresh orange juice for my gorgeous athlete."

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.880
(”Can’t you come back to me, Ploy?”)

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.800
(”I miss you, Ploy.”)

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.480
"What I once thought I had..."

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.360
"In the end, I’ve realized it was only..."

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.400
"Emptiness."

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.240
"Empty all along."

(”The Deviana”)

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.440
Feeling better now, Prang?

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.160
"Prang, just stop trying to fix things for me."

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.000
Prang. Take a break.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.680
You’ll hurt yourself.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.080
"Just stop messing with me already.”

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.920
Have some water, love. Calm down.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.880
You don’t have to hold it. You’ll get hurt.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.240
I don’t mind.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.000
If you don’t take a break, I won’t either.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.000
Let’s do this.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.800
I’m ready, Prang.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.200
Let’s go! One more round.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.400
Go on, Prang!

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.200
Prang!

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.760
Oh! Prang!

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.000
I can’t take it anymore.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.080
"Why did you have to do that, Ploy?"

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.200
Why?

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.840
I don’t think she meant to deceive you, you know.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.720
Are you close with her or something?

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.720
Not really.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.880
Then how can you be so sure?

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.560
Before giving your heart to someone,

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.080
you should make sure
they’ll give theirs back too.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.800
And are you sure

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.840
you haven’t already given yours away?

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.280
"I keep asking myself every day."

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.800
"If Ploy"

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.320
"were to come back into my life again,"

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.280
"How would I feel?"

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.600
“So many times, I think of her smile...”

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.400
"Think of her hug..."

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.720
"And think of... her scent."

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.400
"But this broken heart"

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.400
"has wiped out all of my longing"

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.720
"and pulled me back into reality."

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.960
"You slept with someone else."

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.240
"That’s the truth."

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.240
Goodbye, Ploy.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.520
Pun. You’ll be okay.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.720
You’ll be fine.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.800
I’m right here with you.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.240
What are you doing, Jieab?

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.480
Hm?

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.000
Texting a friend.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.480
Do you have friends?

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.280
Watch your mouth!

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.920
Stop fighting, you two.
Pun’s sad right now.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.680
Then go comfort Pun.
Why are you bothering me?

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.160
Don’t!

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.080
Stop it!

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.120
It’s my babe.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.200
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.480
Since when, Jieab?

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.360
And why didn’t you let us
do a background check first?

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.960
So that’s why you’ve been disappearing lately, huh?

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.560
Ugh, you guys!

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.520
Stop. Enough with all the questions.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.280
It’s not like I wanted to hide it.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.440
I just didn’t feel like telling anyone yet.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.440
See? Pun’s been sad.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.680
Congratulations, Jieab.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.440
Aww.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.520
It’s alright, Pun.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.080
You’ve still got us.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.000
Hey.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.200
How about finding someone new?

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.440
Hmm?

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.720
I ran into Bee the other day.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.040
Bee? That Bee?

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.000
Yeah, the one and only Bee.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.320
She’s even more gorgeous than before.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.960
Where did you see her?

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.400
Aha, someone’s interested.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.280
Want to see her? I can take you.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.080
Hold on. You sure she’s ready for Bee?

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.000
Yeah.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.920
Last time, she really did a number on Pun.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.640
- Still…
- Good!

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.000
- I think it’s a good idea.
- Me too, honestly.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.480
- You’ve got to give it a try.
- Yeah.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.840
- Go for it.
- Just try it first.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.360
I think she’s much prettier now.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.680
If you stood next to each other.
Oh my! A perfect match!

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.760
True, true.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.600
- Is she gorgeous, huh?
- Stunning.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.800
"I don’t even understand why I keep it."

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.040
"Even though I’ve tried so hard to forget."

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.080
"Why do I still take it out
and look at it every night?"

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.920
"You said you’ve been into butterflies lately."

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.320
"Like those paper ones
you folded in your room."

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.680
"Why is that, I wonder?"

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.720
Hey, Phe. How’s it going?

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.800
"I heard they’ve all been caught. Is that true?"

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.840
Yeah. They’ve been trying to track down the rest.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.440
So what will you do next?

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.040
I think I’ll stay in Thailand for a bit longer
before heading back to New York.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.600
"And you, Pun?"

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.120
Do you still want to go back with me?

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:40.920
"I..."

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.200
"I want to make it up to you."

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.720
If you still want citizenship,
I’ll sort it out for you.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.960
This time, I won’t charge you.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.040
I…

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.840
I need a bit more time to think.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.360
Because of Ploy?

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.000
Forget it, Phe.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.400
About Ploy, I…

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.560
Just let me know when you’re leaving.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.760
If I change my mind, I’ll get in touch.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.480
Okay.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.280
Just let me know.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.960
"I’ll sort it out for you."

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.040
"Hello, Ploy? Where are you?"

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.640
What is it, Ji?

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.760
We were supposed to go over your schedule today.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.240
"Did you forget, Ploy?"

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.440
I’m so sorry, I completely forgot.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.640
"That’s alright. Let’s just update here then."

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.400
So, there are five brands reaching out to you,

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.560
all wanting you as their presenter.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.280
"I’ll email you the details, alright?
You can pick which ones you want."

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.120
I’ll take them all.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.040
"Sorry, what?"

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.320
I’ll accept all of them.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.280
"You won’t check them first?"

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.680
Could you handle that for me?

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.440
"Won’t it be too much for you?"

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.920
"Are you sure you can handle it?"

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.840
I can.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.120
Can I ask why?

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.440
If there’s nothing else, I’ll hang up now.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.280
"I’m worried about you."

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.960
Ever since we last met,
you’ve completely disappeared.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.280
Been busy tracking down Phe, that’s all.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.840
Then out of nowhere, he finally reached out.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.040
You got your money back already, right?

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.920
Yeah, I did.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.000
Honestly, I’m still confused.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.840
He owed me half a million,

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.360
owed you a million,

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.680
and who knows how much he owed everyone else.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.800
I’ve no idea where he got the money from.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.560
Someone like Phetai,
I’m sure he’s got his own ways.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.520
Just hope he didn’t borrow
from someone else to pay us back.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.920
Anyway, thank you, really.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:16:59.840
And

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.080
I’m sorry

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.160
I couldn’t help you more.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.920
Oh. Don’t apologize.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.079
But could you at least
look at me while we talk?

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:12.760
It’s better this way.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:15.720
Alright, alright.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.240
Well, you’ve got your money back.
Let’s just put it behind us.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:22.359
I actually came here because

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.160
I was just worried about you.

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:29.400
Wow. Look at you now.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.320
Trying to play the hero, huh?

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.400
Don’t tell me that

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.280
you’re planning to win me over again?

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.120
Ahem. Nope.
I’ve learnt my lesson. No thanks.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.120
I’m afraid your Ploy Pitcha

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.120
will drive up and cut me off again.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.400
I’d rather not risk my car,
too much hassle to fix.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.440
Are you two okay though?

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.000
Having a fight?

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.320
We’re okay, I guess.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.360
At least, I think so.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.160
(”Zero”)

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:24.800
Come on.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.600
Have a drink, will you?

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.800
"I’m worried about you."

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.320
"I don’t want you getting drunk
out of your mind."

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:33.920
No, thanks.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.840
You really saw her here?

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.720
Yeah, all week actually.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.840
Over there, that’s her usual seat.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.680
Sits there, drinking gracefully all night.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:52.880
All by herself?

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:53.880
Yeah.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.840
No other women with her?

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:00.960
So strange.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.960
The bartender said

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.920
she always comes alone
and leaves late at night.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.160
But on the nights she’s drunk,
her friend picks her up.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.840
Look! There she is.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.200
Whiskey on the rocks, please.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.760
Alright then. Pun’s back on the prowl.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.200
Go get her, girl.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.520
Pun?

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.160
You don’t seem very happy.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.680
Still paying for what you did?

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.040
Still mad at me?

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.160
Thanks for taking me home.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.760
My pleasure, Pun.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.120
Is something on your mind, Bee?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.760
Nothing.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:47.600
I was just wondering…
how can someone be as adorable as you?

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.320
Then, can I have something in return?

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.960
So what would you like?

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
I think...

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.800
I should go now.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.360
Alright.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.320
See you.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.760
Back then, did you actually like me?

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.120
I used to think I did.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.960
But when I met the person I truly liked,

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.680
I realized that

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.960
what I felt back then
was nothing close to love.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:22.840
So what now?

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.280
You came over just to mess with me?

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.480
I’m just bored.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.640
I wanted to find something to do about it.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.280
We’re in public.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.120
You’ve really changed.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.240
You didn’t use to think this much.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.320
You’re drunk.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.840
I’m not drunk.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.360
Wanna come to the restroom with me?

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.680
In such a hurry, are you?

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.920
But I haven’t even finished my drink yet.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.200
What are you waiting for then?

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.880
She’s really going for it.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.120
Don’t touch my hair.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.200
I’m sorry.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:50.600
Bee.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:58.760
Ploy.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.760
I’m sorry.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.800
It’s okay. Don’t worry.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.440
I can’t take it anymore.

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.480
It’s alright.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.640
I understand.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.240
- This is your bag.
- Thank you.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.760
Getting with someone else
just to forget another,

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.320
it only makes things messier or heavier.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.320
Especially when you start calling the wrong name
in the middle of it.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.600
I’d say…

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.480
No matter how much you try to fill it,
it’ll never be enough.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:42.720
Trust me.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.000
I just don’t want you to end up regretting it later.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.520
Then what should I do to forget?

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.360
I don’t know either.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.280
It’s hard for me too.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.880
Hello, Bee.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.320
You know me?

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.080
Bee, it’s Best!

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.480
Best Benjamart, the campus star!

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.080
Wow…

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.400
You’re the one who

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.480
got everyone to have a go at me
over what happened with me and Pun?

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.240
That’s right.

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.000
But wow,

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.560
you’ve had quite the glow-up.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.560
A rising star now, huh?

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.360
Ugh.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.600
More like a grow-up, face to boobs,
the whole package.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.520
Wanna test it out?

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.520
"The first time we met"

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.680
"after the Hong Kong trip."

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.360
I think...

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.440
I’ll head off. I shouldn’t stay here.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.560
If there’s no one waiting at home,

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.800
stay and keep me company for a bit?

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.400
Kiss me.

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:49.920
Hm?

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.480
Kiss me now.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.200
Pun, I think we’ve already talked this through.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.120
Oh my gosh!

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.880
Did Ploy just look at me?

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.360
Yeah, she did, straight-faced.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:18.720
But she’s turned away now.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:26.520
You know, I feel like
I’m being used right now.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:32.960
Good.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.000
Best, in ten minutes, follow me outside.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.480
- Mm-hmm.
- I’ll be waiting there with Bee.

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:42.520
Okay.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.120
You come with me.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.480
(sighs)

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.440
I just told you a minute ago.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.880
I’ve got feelings too, Pun.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.040
Is that Ploy Dior?

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.760
You’re aiming high these days, huh?

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.960
So, what’s the plan then?

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.680
You're gonna move on,
or make that actress jealous?

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.240
Do you want her back or not?

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.360
I don’t even know anymore.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.480
You’re about to cry again, aren’t you?

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.400
Bee...

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.960
Am I not lovable?

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.440
Why did you cheat on me then?

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.840
And now Ploy doesn’t care about me at all.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.000
Come here.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.800
First of all,

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.480
me being with someone else

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.720
was on me,

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.360
not because you weren’t good enough.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:36.680
Second,

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.040
I don’t know what’s going on between you two.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.600
But when you dragged me out just now,

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.200
I saw the way Ploy looked at you.

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.000
It was cold, sure.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:57.120
But I could also see caring
and jealousy mixed in.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.960
If she truly cared about me that much,

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.200
she wouldn’t have let you
walk out with me like this.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.200
Trust me, Pun.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.160
That kind of look

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.200
I’ve worn it my whole life.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.160
I’ll head off now.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.160
See you around.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.960
Hey. How are you holding up?

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:32.600
You okay?

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.199
Come here.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.360
Let’s head back.

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:46.639
Get some rest.

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:30.720
♫ Every moment that passed,
I knew it right ♫

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.640
♫ I knew what it was ♫

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:39.360
♫ But I never said a word for anyone to hear ♫

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.800
♫ Each glance, every word you say ♫

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.760
♫ I knew it all ♫

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.000
♫ I knew far more than anyone ♫

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:58.000
♫ But I must hide it all and keep it far from sight ♫

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:04.320
♫ All I feel, I lock it tight ♫

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.600
♫ In my heart ♫

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:10.560
♫ It’s love I need to hide away,
No one else must ever know ♫

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:16.800
♫ Though my heart keeps giving in on its own ♫

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.360
♫ But I have to keep it inside ♫

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:24.600
♫ This love game that I never let be shown,
Every turn of it still kept unknown ♫

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.720
♫ However much I love ♫

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:34.760
♫ I won’t tell it. No one needs to know ♫

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:43.080
♫ What you do, the things you’ve tried, I can ♫

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.120
♫ I can see it ♫

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:51.920
♫ But I never thought to say what I felt ♫

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.680
♫ All the ways you’re good to me each day ♫

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.720
♫ Do you ever know ♫

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.160
♫ I’m the one who lets you act that way ♫

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.280
Ploy.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:14.560
Let’s go.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.200
How did you get this drunk?

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.000
You’ve been disappearing for days.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.720
Jay and I were getting worried.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:20.360
I’m fine now.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.840
Go back to your room, Prang.

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:27.880
It’s about Pun, isn’t it?

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:35.880
I know.

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:38.840
About you and Pun.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.680
Is that so?

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.080
Then I apologize

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.480
for getting involved with your sister.

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.400
What were you thinking?

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.200
It doesn’t matter anymore.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.280
I just want you to be clear about it.

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.600
Leaving things like this only hurts both of you.

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.280
These past few days,

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.520
do you even know what Pun’s been like?

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.800
So you really don’t know what she’s done?

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:38.480
I do.

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.440
How much do you know?

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.600
What else, Prang?

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.160
Ploy…

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.560
Who said you could come in?

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.200
I wanted to talk to you.

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.520
Who dumped you this time?

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.480
You look like a mess.

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.080
What do you want?

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.240
If it’s nothing, please leave.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.480
Why are you being so cruel?

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.400
Have you ever thought about us?

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.800
Have you ever thought about me, Ploy?

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.600
Even once?

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.200
What we had is over.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.320
And it was never real from the start.

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.000
Do you really not want me at all, Ploy?

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.920
In your heart,

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.160
there’s nothing left of me?

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:08.600
was just a game to you?

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.000
I just wanted you to know

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.000
that I love you, Ploy.

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.040
Ploy.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.720
I’m sorry.

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.600
All the mistakes I’ve made...

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.880
Could you try to forgive me

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:50.680
like I’m trying to be about us now?

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:55.520
I...

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.280
I never wanted anything from you.

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.600
I just wanted you, only you.

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:07.000
Only me, is that it?

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.240
Only me,

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.120
yet you seem so interested in my brother.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.640
I know you’ve been lying to me, Pun.

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:29.480
I know you got close to me
to find out about Phetai.

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.280
And I also know

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:43.680
that the day you bailed on me,
you went to get your money back.

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.240
Like I said,

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.440
what we had was never real.

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.440
It was never real from the start.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:09.880
I’m sorry.

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.120
Get out.

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.240
I said, get out.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.640
I’ve had enough of being betrayed.

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.160
- (Next episode)
- Have you spoken to Pun at all?

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:09.360
There’s nothing to talk about.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.720
Stop acting like the victim.

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.000
You lied to Pun too, didn’t you?

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.480
I feel like I’m on the outside.

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:16.880
You really don’t understand me.

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:18.160
I’m sorry then.

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:20.080
Do I not deserve love, Mom?

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.640
Do I not deserve to be happy?

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.000
Don’t you miss me at all?

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:24.960
The only one

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.760
who really loves you,
who’s stayed true to you is me.
