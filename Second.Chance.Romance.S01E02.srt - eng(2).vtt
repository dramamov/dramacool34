[Episode 2]

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.620
Siting,

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.060
your second audition is tomorrow.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.220
I hope I make it through.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.780
If you get in,

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.100
will you go abroad for further training?

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.900
Who knows if I'll even pass?

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:49.980
You'll definitely get in.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.980
You always know what to say.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.860
Here.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.260
Did I tell you?

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.220
Zeyuan earned money
by writing code for someone.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.580
He said once he gets paid,

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.700
he's treating us to a big meal.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:59.940
That's amazing.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.340
Then I'd better start thinking

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.740
about how to make that meal count.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.420
Totally okay.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.540
I don't know

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.780
what my mom ate
when she was pregnant with him.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.460
How come he's so much smarter than me?

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.260
So hardworking and driven.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.940
Top of everything you do, right?

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.540
Wang Shuhan, that's enough.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.420
Did you forget why we're here today?

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.380
Alright, I'll stop.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.500
Siting, we came specifically

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.940
to cheer you on today.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.340
Right.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.980
Let's use this as a toast.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.700
To your success tomorrow

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.540
and getting into Queen Ballet.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.780
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.940
I don't know.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.940
Her shoes.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.260
I don't know what's going on.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.140
Something's wrong with the shoes.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.420
What do you think?

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.300
Hello, do you have a reservation?

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.940
Table one.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.620
Right this way, please.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.700
Alright. You're about to burst.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.780
Please, come in.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.980
Tan Siting!

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.260
I've missed you so much.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.140
After all these years,
you're finally back.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.180
Why didn't you call me
the second you landed?

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.940
If I'd called you
the moment I got off the plane,

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.780
would you have even answered?

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.740
Fine. Let me get a good look at you.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.220
Let me see you.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.500
What are you doing?

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.740
Oh my god.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.340
Life is so unfair.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.420
How is it unfair?

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.100
Of course it is.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.420
Look at you,
still so beautiful and thin.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.940
Look at me.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.940
I've gotten so fat that...

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.620
Look.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.980
What's wrong? You look gorgeous now.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.260
Let's not talk standing up. Sit down.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.820
Come on.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.500
Okay.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.900
I brought wine.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.540
Come on.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.980
Okay.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.900
Come here.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.220
Have a seat.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.500
Isn't this the seat for paying the bill?

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.460
You won't be paying.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.980
Today, everything's on Wang Zeyuan.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.100
Listen, Tan Siting,

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.580
I flew in on a full-price

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.820
business class ticket
just to see you the moment

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:02.300
you got back.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.780
Reimburse me.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.820
Fine, I will.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.260
I just got back

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.940
and Wang Shuhan already
scammed a fortune out of me.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.420
I'll cover it.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.060
Look at you, pathetic.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.980
Come on, to celebrate Siting's return,

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.100
let's have a toast.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.860
Cheers!

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.540
You finished it all?

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.020
I'm really, really happy Siting is back.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.780
Another round?

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.140
Easy does it.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.900
If you drink too much,

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.140
you're gonna make a scene, right?

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.020
Let me tell you, my alcohol tolerance
has improved over the years.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.500
It's not just your tolerance
that's grown.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.540
Your weight has too.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.260
Do I need you to tell me that?

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.940
It's obvious to everyone.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.500
If you tell anyone my weight

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.700
after leaving this room,

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.540
I'll kill you.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.900
Let's drop this.
It's killing my appetite.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.740
Siting,

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.380
how was life over there for you?

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.420
Pretty simple.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.660
A daily routine

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.660
between the theater and home.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.140
Got to travel around sometimes
during tours.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.940
Zeyuan said

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.980
there's still no news
about your dad, right?

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.300
Right.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.420
My dad doesn't have many relatives.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.540
Just a distant cousin.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.740
I contacted her.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.140
She said my dad hasn't reached out
to her all these years.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.460
I posted a missing person notice
for you online.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.580
If your dad
or anyone who knows him sees it,

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.700
they'll contact us.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.900
Thank you.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.700
Right.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.300
Zeyuan is an expert
in that whole internet field.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.660
He posted that notice.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.820
It's bound to help.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.940
Big changes, huh?

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.100
Quite big.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.700
Have I changed much?

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:37.540
Haven't I?

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.780
You've gotten more beautiful.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.500
Let me tell you,

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.380
I never thought
I'd turn out like this either.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.740
And I never imagined

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.860
I'd be living the life I have now.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.380
Shuhan, you know what?

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.620
I've always envied you.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.500
Look,

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.300
you have

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.340
both your parents by your side.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.940
And

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.060
you have such a thoughtful
and caring brother.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.220
Do you know

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.540
how many years it's been

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.260
since I last saw

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.860
my dad?

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.460
So,

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.100
you should be content.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.900
That's how you live happily.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.420
I am content.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.340
You envy me?

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:24.980
I'm the one who envies you.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.780
Since you came back,

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.700
have you seen that guy?

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.580
Who?

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.420
Don't play dumb.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.340
Feng Rui?

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.780
Yes, I have.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.260
This afternoon.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.740
So what's the deal with you two?

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:45.540
Tell me.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:46.180
And

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.900
I heard he's not

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.660
at his grandfather's company anymore.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.980
Seems he started
his own winery or something.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.980
The wine
you were downing earlier was his.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.860
I thought you brought it back

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.140
from France for me.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.940
With all that luggage,
you think I could carry wine?

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.500
So who reached out to whom?

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.380
No one reached out.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.620
I was just walking around this afternoon

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.180
and happened to

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.780
stumble into his winery.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.940
So we chatted for a bit.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.020
That's it?

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.020
What else?

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.340
You're not
rekindling old flames, are you?

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.100
Enough.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.180
What are you talking about?

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.740
When I was about to leave,

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.460
his wife and kid showed up.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.140
His kid is already this tall.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.300
Well, forget him then.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.180
You don't need him.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.500
I'll set you up.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.620
I know tons of cute guys.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.620
All top-tier.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.460
You keep your top-tier guys.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.780
Gosh, you're incredibly confident.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:46.740
Top-tier?

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.020
I'll introduce you to someone.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.980
Otherwise, you'll be
all lonely back here.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.260
I'm not lonely.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.180
For real.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:53.940
Alright.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:03.620
Grandma.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.260
Madam, you're here.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:04.900
Mom.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:05.900
Madam.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.340
Peiyan, you're here.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.220
You brought so many things.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:08.740
Let me.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.340
No, it's fine.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.020
Alright.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:10.300
What brings you here?

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.020
Come on.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:11.780
Sit down.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:12.700
Have you eaten?

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.820
Would you like to join us?

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:14.460
Don't bother.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.260
I've already eaten.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:15.820
Come here.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:16.740
Come on.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.060
This must be Peiyan's cooking?

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.380
I just whipped up something simple
with what was in the fridge.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.420
It looks delicious.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:23.980
Have some, Mom.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:24.460
Sit down.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.300
I've eaten. Sit down.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:26.860
Peiyan,

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.660
have a seat.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:29.900
Thank you.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:30.980
No problem.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:31.700
Next time,

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:32.820
I'll get proper ingredients

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.500
and make you
some of my specialty dishes.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:35.340
Okay.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.740
Grandma, what are you doing here?

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.340
I...

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.860
Tomorrow's the weekend.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.900
Do you want to go to my place?

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:49.980
No.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:50.900
I haven't finished eating.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.620
And I still have homework.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.060
I brought a game console.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.140
I'm full now.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.140
Let's go. Game console.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.100
Grab your homework.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:02.780
You didn't finish.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:03.620
Let's go.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.060
Alright, we'll head out.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.180
I'm pretty much done, too.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:06.900
Don't bother.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.380
You two keep eating.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.380
Be careful.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.660
Got everything?

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:12.140
Got it.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:12.500
I got everything.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.900
Don't just play games.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.100
You have piano lessons tomorrow.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:15.460
Okay.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.740
Don't worry. I'll do my homework
before playing games.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.660
Madam, let me see you out.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.060
It's fine.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:19.660
Don't bother.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:20.140
We'll walk you...

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.180
By the way,

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.940
I'll bring him back tomorrow.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.060
Ma'am, bye...

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.860
It's been a while
since you last visited me.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.020
Yeah.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:38.780
Lu.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:39.540
Put it here.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.260
Okay.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.180
Head back and get some rest.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.220
Alright, Ms. Gao.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:44.980
I'll get going then.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:45.300
Okay.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:45.740
Grandma.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:46.180
Bye, Ms. Gao.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:47.100
Close the door.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:47.660
Grandma?

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.020
You haven't thrown away

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.020
these old toys of mine?

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.380
Of course not.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.100
Every toy holds a story of yours.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.940
Seeing them

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.180
reminds me
of how mischievous you were as a child.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:00.980
Grandma,

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.940
what was my mom like?

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.340
Why bring her up?

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.220
Nothing.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:13.740
It's just that

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.540
sometimes I feel Dad is too quiet.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.740
He's such a straightforward guy.
He knows nothing.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:20.740
I take after my mom.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.020
I'm a vibrant, dream-chasing young man!

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.300
Right, Grandma?

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.460
Let me ask you,

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:29.860
how would you feel

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.940
if your dad ended up

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.460
with Ms. Wen?

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:35.900
Would you be happy?

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.660
I'd be super happy!

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.780
No more takeout for me then.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:41.580
Exactly.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.900
Look at Ms. Wen.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.140
She's graceful and dignified.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.020
Right.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:46.620
She's pretty.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.300
And she can cook, right?

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.860
Some birth mothers

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.460
aren't even like that.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.220
Yeah.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:58.020
So we have to team up

00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.100
and get your dad...

00:10:59.540 --> 00:10:59.980
A girlfriend!

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:00.460
Right.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.460
My mom really spoils Lexuan.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.780
Grandparents just

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:07.980
dote on their grandchildren.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.100
It's understandable.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.980
But Lexuan has really grown up.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.580
He even teases us now.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.100
Kids these days understand everything.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.500
How mature
do you think Lexuan is for his age?

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.460
Probably more mature

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.860
than other kids his age.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.740
Sometimes when I talk to him,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.300
it almost

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.340
feels like

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.620
I'm talking to an adult.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.020
He's so sensible.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.780
That's why we communicate so well.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.140
But it's almost heartbreaking
how sensible he is.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:42.500
Don't you think?

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:46.940
He's a boy.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.980
It's fine if he matures a bit early.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.300
In fact, it might be good for him.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.500
But kids should act like kids.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.260
If Lexuan were my child,

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.020
I wouldn't want him to be this sensible.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.900
I'd want him to make mistakes,

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:04.980
be willful,

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.100
and act coquettishly.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:07.940
Everyone

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.660
grows up eventually.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.540
But once childhood is gone,

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.380
it will never come back.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:14.620
You're right.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.780
And you're a good student.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.700
Quick to absorb the right ideas
from your teacher.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.140
I should let him keep
his childlike innocence.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:26.820
He doesn't need to be so strong.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:29.940
You're the same.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.780
You don't always have to

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.380
act so strong, either.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.620
It's okay to let your guard down

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.540
around people you trust, right?

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.620
Alright, everyone.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.260
This is our new guest teacher,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:02.020
Tan Siting.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.260
I'm sure

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.820
you all recognize her.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.860
Ms. Tan was the prima ballerina
at France's Amour Ballet.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.540
She came to us right after retiring.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:10.900
We're truly honored.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.220
And I'm honored to work with all of you.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:14.300
Ms. Tan

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.100
turned down

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.860
an invitation
from France's Royal Ballet School

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.180
to teach here.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.540
I hope you'll all work together

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.020
and focus on nurturing the children.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.900
Let's skip the formalities.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.500
The immediate priority

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.140
is that Zheng Yufan

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:30.940
has less than two months left

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:31.820
before the YGP

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.460
Japan regional competition.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:34.820
I've been training Yufan

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.180
for over a year.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:37.380
She's very talented.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.060
For the YGP this time,

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.420
we submitted her video
to the judging panel

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.900
on a trial basis.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.500
Unexpectedly,
she passed the preliminary selection.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.740
She'll be going to Japan
to compete soon.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:49.260
But

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.780
lately,

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.020
I feel her progress has stalled.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:54.940
Maybe it's time

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.900
for a change.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:13:59.700
Ms. Guan,

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.060
you've trained Zheng Yufan
for a long time

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.060
and worked very hard.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.380
I think

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.140
maybe you should let her

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:07.980
train under Ms. Tan for a while.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.300
See if that brings any change.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:11.340
What do you think?

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:12.900
Sure.

Draw in your waist.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:17.660
What about the chest and waist?

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:21.620
Knees straight.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.180
Everyone, knees straight.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:24.980
Yes. Shoulders down.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.540

Sure. Just a moment.

Hello.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:20.460
Yeah.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:22.340
Hasn't changed.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.060

Just a moment, Lexuan.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.340
This lady ordered first.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:33.980

Yeah.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:52.860
Not staying for a bit?

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.380
Better not.

Not bad.

No.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.500
I teach ballet here.

we didn't really talk much.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:11.460
She just

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.020

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.300
compared to before.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.980
At least he's not
as formal as he used to be.

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:42.660
That's good.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:46.500
Mom.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.740
Look, she can cook so many dishes.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.900
Madam, I've always said I wanted to
cook a proper meal for you.

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.380
Finally got the chance today.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.540

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:14.700
Skip it.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:15.220
Okay.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:18.980
This soup is delicious too.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:22.380
Let me try.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:25.980
By the way, Lexuan,

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.180
Ms. Yan said the piece
for your Children's Day performance

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:28.980
is quite challenging.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.260
You'll need to
put in more effort lately.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:31.900
I know.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.220
After this meal, I'm going
into serious practice mode.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.500
Should we ask Ms. Wen to tutor you?

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:39.180
No problem.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.660
Lexuan and I work well together.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:41.580
It'll be fine, right?

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:42.620
Absolutely.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:44.420
Oh, Rui,

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.740
guess who I ran into at school today?

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:47.380
Who?

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:48.980
That friend of yours

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.540
we met at the winery,

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:52.220
Tan Siting.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:56.140
What a coincidence.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.340
She's now

00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.740
actually a ballet teacher

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:00.820
at our training center.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.620
We're colleagues.

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:04.300
Yes.

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:05.460
She did mention

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.380
she was coming back
to teach after retiring.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.020
This soup is really good.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:17.580
Could you get me...?

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:18.660
Let me get you.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:19.900
Okay.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.060
Thanks, Mom.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:24.660
Let me get you some of that.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:25.460
Try it.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:25.740
Okay.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.340
You met her?

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:42.220
Who?

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:49.540
Tan Siting.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:50.940
Yes... I have seen her.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.140
Why didn't you tell me?

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.540
Do I have to report everything to you?

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:55.900
What did you talk about?

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.380
Just ordinary greetings and small talk.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:00.580
No further contact?

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:02.980
We just met once.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.580
Didn't exchange any contact information.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:09.820
It's strange.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.100
Of all places,

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:14.900
she runs into you in this city.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:16.220
Of all places,

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.380
she stumbles into your winery.

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:20.380
And now

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.820
she happens to be colleagues
with Peiyan.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.220
Don't you find that odd?

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.060
What she does

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.060
has nothing to do with me.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:01.020
Rui,

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.260
don't forget.

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:06.380
Back then, for the sake of her career,

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.060
she didn't care about anything else.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.220
She left a letter and ran off to France.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:14.540
Lexuan

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.860
was only this small back then.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.220
I worked myself to the bone.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:21.100
I ignored the company

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.580
just to help you raise the child.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.100
We finally got our lives back on track.

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.020
And now she suddenly reappears.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.020
What does she want?

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.900
Does she want to ruin our lives again?

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:35.340
Mom,

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:38.940
it's impossible

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.020
between her and me now.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:43.980
She's met Lexuan.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:46.020
But she

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:46.980
showed no reaction to him.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:48.580
I've completely given up on her.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.140
She can no longer affect our family,

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:51.700
and she certainly can't affect me.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.380
I'm relieved

00:25:58.820 --> 00:25:59.780
to hear you say that.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:02.060
I just wanted to remind you.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.260
Also,

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:08.860
Peiyan

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:13.220
is so good to you and Lexuan.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:15.940
We

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.060
shouldn't fail her.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:29.460
You should head back.

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:47.860
Head position.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:48.340
Hands.

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.300
Watch your toes.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:56.540
Good.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:59.020
Move together.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.140
Very good.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.100
You did a great job
with the pirouette today.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.100
But still,

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.060
pay attention to the emotion.

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.580
You must feel the emotion
before you start dancing.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:13.260
Okay.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.180
Alright. You can go now.

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:14.900
Practice well.

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:15.860
Thank you, ma'am.

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:16.820
Okay. Bye.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:30.500
Ms. Tan!

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:32.660
Someone's at the door asking for you.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:02.180
You were doing just fine in Paris.

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:04.820
Why come back all of a sudden?

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:06.860
I came back because I wanted to.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.220
Do I need to

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.100
check with you first?

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:11.620
What

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.060
are you planning to do here?

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:16.940
What are you trying to say?

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.460
I said

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.700
all I needed to say twelve years ago.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:23.820
But

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:27.860
I'm not sure you understood me clearly.

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.740
You made yourself perfectly clear.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:32.100
No need to waste your breath.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:33.660
If there's nothing else,

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.140
I have another class to teach.

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:36.100
I'm leaving.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:37.180
Wait.

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:40.140
You've seen it yourself.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:41.740
Rui

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.020
has found his partner.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.700
They're very happy together.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:48.700
Before I came,

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.820
I asked for his opinion.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.140
He said

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.740
he never wants to see you again.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:28:59.660
What's past

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:02.700
is past.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:05.900
So

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:09.900
I hope you'll stop bothering him.

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.220
Is this just you being presumptuous?

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.780
I have no interest in anyone or anything

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:18.020
related to your family.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:19.940
I just happened to

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.260
bump into your daughter-in-law
at the training center.

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:24.740
And I won't be going there.

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:26.260
Good.

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.420
I hope you'll keep your word.

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.220
If it's about money,

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.620
you don't need to go to such lengths.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:37.700
You could have

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:39.620
come to me.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:41.980
You really haven't changed.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.580
After all these years,
you're still the same.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.580
Thinking that money
can solve everything.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:49.260
Thanks.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:51.020
But I don't need your money.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:28.820
There's

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:31.700
500,000 in here.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:35.340
I want you

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:37.700
to leave Rui.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.060
Gao Hui,

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.140
you must've been waiting
a long time for this.

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.860
You deliberately sent Feng Rui away,

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:54.460
made sure I had the baby,

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.780
and then kept us from seeing each other.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:01.900
The more you think that,

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.860
the more I have to tell Feng Rui
what happened!

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:06.940
I will wait for him to come back!

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:09.580
I'll tell him myself

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:10.860
that we lost our baby.

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:13.860
I want him to see

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.260
what his wonderful mother

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:16.780
has done.

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:24.020
You can tell him,

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:27.380
but

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.580
have you considered

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.300
that my brother Haotian and your father

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.100
will always be a barrier between us?

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.420
Even if

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:41.700
you stay together

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:42.820
for a year,

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.660
two years, or even three,

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:46.220
one day,

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:49.140
one of their names will come up.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:50.780
And when it does,

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.700
you'll argue,

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:53.340
fight,

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.380
and even hurt each other,

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.420
until all the love and respect

00:31:58.940 --> 00:31:59.860
are gone.

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.540
Is that what you want?

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.100
Do you really want to end up

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:04.620
tearing each other apart,

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:07.820
never speaking again?

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:10.660
It'd be better

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:12.660
for both of you

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.260
to focus on your careers now.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.740
I think that's the best choice.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:02.820
Maybe

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:04.660
we should just be together.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.060
Why bring this up all of a sudden?

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:15.940
I just feel like

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.340
we're already like a family now.

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:20.620
I pick up Lexuan from school,

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:21.940
teach him piano,

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.300
cook for both of you, and...

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:24.340
Okay.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:29.380
What did you say?

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:31.660
I said

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:32.380
okay.

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:36.940
Are you serious?

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:38.260
Of course.

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:40.660
Aren't you serious?

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:46.700
Of... Of course I am.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:51.380
Then it's settled?

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:54.180
Okay.

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:55.260
Settled.

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:11.180
Well,

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:12.420
I should get going now.

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:13.980
Good night.

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:15.820
Good night.

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:21.860
