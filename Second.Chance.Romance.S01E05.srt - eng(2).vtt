[Episode 5]

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.020
Still no news from your dad?

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.780
None.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.420
We've asked everyone we should,

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.900
and searched everywhere we could,

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.340
yet not a single clue.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.860
He wanted to leave this sad place,

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.060
probably because what happened earlier

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.220
struck him.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:07.620
He didn't tell you

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.340
because he didn't want to trouble you.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.940
I understand how he feels.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.340
I also know that.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.540
But haven't seen him for years.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.540
I'm desperate to find him now.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.420
I've asked my friends to help inquire.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.900
Once there's any news,

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.260
I'll let you know.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.540
Thank you, Yuan.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.340
You don't have to thank me.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.980
Yuan.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.060
About your sponsorship for the school,

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.540
first of all, thank you.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.500
I know how incredibly kind-hearted

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.460
and passionate you are,

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.620
but if this is...

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.340
I'm fully giving back to society.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.300
Overthinking it.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.100
Hope I'm overthinking,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.700
but I need to say this.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.260
If it is because of me,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.700
please don't do this again.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.220
I admit

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.460
the donation started with you,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.260
but everything I said before

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.260
was completely true.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.220
I first knew about ballet through you.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.180
I hope our country's ballet scene

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.540
can develop even further.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:25.740
As for the donation,

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.940
please don't feel burdened by it.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.140
I was doing what I believe is right.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.300
Besides,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.420
I'm no billionaire,

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.060
just a small-time boss
who earned some modest profits.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.620
Only get to be self-indulgent
now and then.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.380
Just let me have this.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.340
I said that
just because you're not that wealthy.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.700
You have only earned modest profits.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:45.660
No repeats,

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:46.340
okay?

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.740
Here.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.180
Yeah.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.740
You probably won't invite me up

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.540
for drinks?

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.020
I just moved in,

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.460
so the place is still a mess.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.580
Not really fit for guests yet.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.700
But I'll have you over once it's set!

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.260
Okay.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.420
I'm leaving.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.540
Bye!

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.100
Take care!

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.660
Okay.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.940
Siting.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.100
Does your phone want me up?

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.620
You brat.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.340
Never change

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.140
your forgetful habit.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.700
Siting,

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.260
having you back

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.340
is such a gift.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.420
Bye now!

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.740
Drive safely.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.900
Bye.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.500
Remember to bring Peiyan home
tomorrow afternoon,

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.060
so your grandfather can see her.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.140
I want to marry Ting.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.900
Rui,

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.140
you've always been sensible.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.300
Whether with business matters

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.500
or family responsibilities,

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:43.500
you give us

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.460
the least worries.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.180
Honestly,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.940
Haotian didn't compare to you.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:50.820
You two

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.540
grew up together

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.180
like brothers,

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.580
though he's technically your elder.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.700
This whole situation

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.020
caught everyone off guard.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.340
Even if

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:05.700
Tan had no intention

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.980
of blackmailing Haotian,

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.740
Haotian's death

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.900
rests on his hands!

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.980
Yet you want to marry her?

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.300
Want to add more drama to us?

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.540
Are you trying to trap us

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.940
in this pain forever

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.740
and reminding us of Haotian's death?

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.940
Feng Rui,

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.860
think this through.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.860
What your mother said makes sense.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.980
Even if what you said is true,

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.180
it has nothing to do with Ting.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.220
She knows nothing about this.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.260
We've been together

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.340
for so long now.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.940
I know her true nature all too well.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.540
Haotian is dead,

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.980
but will his shadow haunt my life?

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:44.980
In your heart,

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.860
is he more important than me?

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.020
You pampered him endlessly
since childhood.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.260
Did you ever consider my feelings?

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.140
He was reckless and carefree,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.740
while I must be sensible and obedient.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.540
Is that fair?

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:58.900
Stop it!

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.980
End it now.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:02.460
I can't.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.860
She's pregnant.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.780
Carrying my child.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.580
Whether you approve or not,

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.020
we're staying together

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.020
and having this baby.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:28.820
When it mattered most,

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.620
you didn't say a word.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.900
What more can I say?

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.380
She's pregnant.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.380
Let this child be born.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.700
Though it's hard to accept,

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.140
this is Rui's child after all.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.180
I've lost Haotian.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.060
I can't lose my great-grandchild.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.820
Have you set a date yet?

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.180
Rui, step up.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.860
Don't keep her waiting.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.340
We're preparing everything.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.620
Rui's fully committed.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:12.620
Please don't worry.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:13.900
Good.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:14.620
I'm here.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.540
You've arrived already.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.860
You got here before me.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.180
We were chatting

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.220
for a while.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.380
Yan is obviously a good girl.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.460
Rui is really lucky.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.100
Yes, Dad.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.500
Let me help you.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.060
No need.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.140
Ms. Ming's here at home.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:30.980
Ms. Ming.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:32.740
Please sit.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:33.380
Have a seat!

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:33.620
Here.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:34.140
Have a seat.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:34.620
Get this

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:36.660
and this.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.260
You should sit down.

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.260
Your grandfather and father

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.380
were so happy

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.700
when they heard your news.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:50.300
Yes.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:52.340
Dad,

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:53.820
here you are.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:54.780
You give it.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:55.620
You give it to her.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:55.940
You do it.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:56.580
Dad, you…

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:57.260
Hurry up.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:01.580
Here.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.660
Open it.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.420
This is our family heirloom.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.700
Now we're giving it to you.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:20.900
Isn't this

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.980
too soon?

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.140
Not at all.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.700
You've known each other for years.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.820
Since you've decided to marry,

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.500
build your own family

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.140
as soon as possible.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.140
But this gift is too valuable

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.180
and my family isn't formal about this.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.060
Please accept it.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.420
From now on,

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.460
please take care of Rui.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:49.500
Please take it.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.020
Alright then.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.300
I'll keep it.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.260
Thank you.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:04.180
Everything is lovely,

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.260
though it makes me gain weight easily.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:05.700
Indeed.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.100
Why did you buy Le the model airplane?

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.020
I thought you have serious matters.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:13.100
Look,

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.420
you spent 30,000 yuan

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.540
teaching him dishonesty.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.060
We should play fair,

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:20.820
right?

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.140
When others pay,

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.460
of course we have to pay too!

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.140
What is the competition about?

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.260
I know what you want to say.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.340
Those children bullied him last time,

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.420
and now they're trying to humiliate him.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.340
But I want to teach Le

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.740
how to build his self-confidence.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.700
That may be true,

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:39.860
but this isn't honest.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.300
Do you want him to accept dishonesty?

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.340
Rui,

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.580
stop making such a big deal

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.020
out of every parenting issue.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.820
Don't be so stubborn.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:50.660
Fine.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.380
But

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.340
don't do this again.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:54.100
Rui,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.500
I won't meddle
with your way of parenting.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.780
Don't tell me
how to spend money on the child,

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:00.500
okay?

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.020
Money isn't the solution to everything.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.580
How did it go with your mom just now?

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.660
Did you speak to her gently?

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.220
Well,

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.740
just talked things through.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.620
The grandparent syndrome.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:34.860
She only did this

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.580
to make Le happy.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:40.020
No.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.460
I shouldn't have interfered.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.620
This is between you and your mom.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.980
I trust you'll handle it well.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.980
Is this really your family's heirloom?

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.700
Is it appropriate?

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.180
Of course.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:07.860
I mean

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.380
should I accept it?

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:13.300
Absolutely.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.180
Why did you stop?

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:58.460
It's pointless.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.460
What do you mean?

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.380
Dancing is pointless.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:04.540
Repeating it so many times,

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.540
I feel like a machine.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:07.700
There's no joy in it.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.420
You're quite perceptive,

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.380
recognizing where your frustration lies.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:14.740
What do you mean?

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.900
Your technique is flawless,

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.500
but nothing here.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.220
You're going back home every day.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.060
Don't you live in the dorms?

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.060
No. I go home.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.020
Ms. Tan.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:45.740
Dad,

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.860
could we use a more powerful motor

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.780
to increase the thrust-to-weight ratio?

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.980
Theoretically possible,

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.220
but your school rules require

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.700
identical power configurations
for everyone.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.380
So that won't work.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.620
But here's another angle.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.500
To reduce the plane's weight.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.100
Hello,

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:18.980
Ms. Tan.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:20.620
I'm right across from you.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:33.980
What are you doing here?

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:35.660
Heading to rehearsal?

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:41.940
I'll take you to a place.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.260
Modify the plane's exterior

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.100
to boost its stability.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.300
How?

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.380
Right here,

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.940
add a wing fence

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.100
on each main wing.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.500
Increased stability means

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.060
straighter, faster flight.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.100
Isn't raw speed what you want?

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.220
Let's get to work.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.540
First, remove this section.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:25.980
This part.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.420
Is this a lesson for today?

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.220
You could say yes

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.260
or no.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.460
Anyway.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.580
Eat as you like.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:08.860
You earned it with today's workout.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:12.900
Taste good?

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:13.460
Yes.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.740
If no milk in it, I'd have eaten it.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:18.860
Was that fun just now?

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:20.180
Yeah.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:23.580
So dance

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.660
doesn't just happen in the studio.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.220
It doesn't even

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.380
belong solely to the stage.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:34.500
Thanks.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:36.740
For what?

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.700
For teaching me how to feel it.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:41.780
That's all?

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:42.980
Nothing more than that?

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.060
Dance

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:47.980
should be joyful,

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.540
like eating ice cream.

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.420
I shouldn't chase only success.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.340
If you see dance

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.700
as your life,

00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.700
don't feel merely

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:00.540
its pain

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:02.500
in life.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.100
Because

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.380
I know rehearsals hurt.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:05.980
But

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:07.300
your life

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.580
can't be defined by pain alone.

00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:13.860
You have talent

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:14.580
and relentless drive.

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:16.380
But as you push so hard,

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:17.620
you only focus

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.260
on rehearsals

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.620
and perfecting movements.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.940
If you want to be a dancer,

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.740
cultivate awareness of people

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.740
and things around you,

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.260
especially beauty in ordinary things.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:29.940
I still believe

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.820
you were born for ballet.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:41.700
Dad,

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.740
if I'd known you were so skilled,

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.460
I would've sought your guidance
from day one.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.260
Would've saved me many detours!

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.100
Well, whose fault is that?

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.980
You're too busy even to see me.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.340
Besides,

00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:58.900
our family's always

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.180
been in the wine business.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.540
Never thought you had
model airplane expertise.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.620
Do you love model airplanes?

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.500
Of course!

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.020
Every boy dreams

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.660
of conquering space.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.300
That's why I joined

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.940
every school competition.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.620
With my smarts,

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.980
I'm somewhat of a legend

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.100
in youth model airplane circles.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:21.820
A legend, huh?

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.420
Both sides are set up now.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:24.860
It's ready.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:25.500
I'll connect them.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.020
Okay. Come on.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.020
Did you ever have dreams?

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:31.100
Of course I did.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:33.620
Why did you give them up?

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.660
It's complicated.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:37.660
Because of me?

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:39.900
What?

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.340
Mom chased her dreams bravely,

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.220
while you gave yours up

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.980
to take care of me, right?

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.860
Don't think that way.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.340
Life brings countless experiences

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.180
and countless people.

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.740
Any of them could alter your path.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:56.740
But I still believe

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.740
you've sacrificed a lot for me.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:00.900
Truly didn't.

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.220
I once dreamed of aerospace,

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.580
but now my dreams

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.380
are my wine business,

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.460
and watching you grow up.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.260
So I hope you'll persevere

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.940
with what sets your soul alive.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.620
That was quite moving.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.260
Now let's test fly.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:28.140
Alright!

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:29.300
Yes!

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.180
Success!

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.620
Way to go, Dad.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:36.780
What do you say?

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:37.540
Incredible.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.300
Want to give it a try?

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:38.860
Go.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:39.300
Come on.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:39.780
Try it.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.220
Go!

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:58.240
[The 9th Grade-Level
Model Airplane Finals Scorecard]

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.080
Come on!

00:19:59.080 --> 00:19:59.940
Keep going!

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.460
The flight team is taking the field.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.060
Push harder.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:30.660
Go!

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.860
Go for it.

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.220
Give it up for them.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.060
Presenting the gold medals.

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.820
A huge round of applause!

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:04.380
Tiring you out?

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:07.660
We did it.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.500
Finally

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:10.940
got something here.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.540
The label of Huacan's

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.900
new wine is genuinely

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.380
clean and sophisticated.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.780
Something we can learn from.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.100
But what matters is the taste.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:23.740
Here.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:37.740
What do you think?

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.460
Noticeably sweet.

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.900
I find it quite pleasant.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.020
Hao makes a valid point.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:47.220
For Riesling,

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.100
the sweetness-acidity balance

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.540
should be moderate.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.540
This is too sweet,

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.060
though ladies might favor it.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:56.940
Is the Pinot Noir ready?

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.060
Yes.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:58.620
Decanted?

00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:59.380
Yes.

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.300
Compared to Cabernet Sauvignon,
Pinot Noir is softer,

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.620
with a paler hue, less tannic,

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.420
and lighter body, full-bodied.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.420
Yet it carries such finesse

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.540
with notes of delicate wild flowers.

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.740
Really something for the palate

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:31.780
to discover.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.260
But this...

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.380
doesn't surpass our Cygne.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:38.940
Exactly.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:39.980
We haven't unleashed

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.740
our flagship Cabernet yet.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.580
If they're fielding these two wines,

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.740
I'd say our odds look favorable.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.500
This tasting event

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:52.180
could be huge

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.180
for our brand exposure.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:56.420
Industry heavyweights

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:57.980
will be there.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.260
Huacan's bringing

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:00.820
their best reserves

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.380
to compete with us.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.220
What wine should we counter with?

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:30.820
Walk through again.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:39.540
Little boy,

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:40.340
is there something

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:41.340
you forgot to pay for?

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:42.940
I didn't buy anything.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.420
And only my own stuff is in my bag.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.460
See, our security gate

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:48.220
only beeps

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.420
when you walk through

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.580
with unpaid items.

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:51.220
Could we check

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:52.860
what's in your bag?

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:56.140
Fine.

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:13.500
This isn't mine.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.780
I don't know why it is in my bag.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:16.780
School supplies

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:18.580
don't grow legs,

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.220
nor can they hop into your bag.

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:20.940
Do you understand?

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.460
I swear I didn't take it.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.700
It wasn't me.

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.180
Either pay for it

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.380
or admit what happened.

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:28.820
Do that, and we'll let this go.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:29.620
We won't tell

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.140
your parents or school.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:31.620
Deal?

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.300
I won't pay,

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.540
or admit it,

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.620
because I never took it.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:38.100
Hey, you,

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:39.580
just own up to it.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.180
We'll let you go.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.980
Why should I, since I never did?

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.660
We're not accusing you falsely.

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.260
This item

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.140
was found in your bag,

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:47.820
right?

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.420
If you didn't put it there,

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:50.540
who else could have?

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:51.780
I did not steal anything.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:53.420
Call the police then.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.060
They'll teach you a lesson.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:55.700
Child,

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.100
admit your mistake.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.340
Or you can just buy the item.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.500
It's barely anything.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:02.580
If you're sent to the police station,

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.140
your future may be ruined.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.420
This isn't about money.

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:07.940
Paying would mean

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.060
I admit stealing,

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.940
but I didn't steal it.

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:12.940
I refuse.

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.940
I won't admit what I didn't do.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:16.940
You have security cameras.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:18.460
Just check the footage.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.380
Let me through, please.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:22.500
Ms. Tan.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:23.380
Le,

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:25.700
I saw what happened

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:27.420
with that pen.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:28.940
I can vouch for you.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:29.620
Exactly.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.460
I was reading behind that bookshelf

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:32.660
by the glass panel.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.420
It's a blind spot,

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:36.860
probably with no camera coverage.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:38.380
Blind spot?

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.420
What's your evidence

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:42.980
to prove he stole this pen?

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:43.380
Well.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.420
We found it in his bag.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:47.980
Then

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.620
could this

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.500
be considered defamation?

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:53.060
Seems we have to go

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.140
down to the police station.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:57.140
Let it go.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.180
It isn't something valuable.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.380
Troublesome to go there.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:00.780
The police are busy enough

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.380
and we've got much going on here.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:03.100
Let it go.

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:06.780
This isn't about money.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.940
It may seem small to adults,

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:09.900
but for a child,

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.460
this is everything.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.220
His reputation is at stake,

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.900
so we must get to the truth.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:17.500
Ren Zhexi,

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:19.340
don't leave.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.940
You put it in my bag, right?

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.340
Any proof?

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.380
How dare you talk nonsense!

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:29.820
Ms. Tan,

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.060
he lost to me
in this morning's competition,

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:33.860
so he holds a grudge
and wants to get back at me.

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:35.740
If that's your story,

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:37.460
we should go to the police station.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.180
We can investigate.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.140
If his fingerprints are on this pen,

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.500
it means he planted it.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:43.980
Once they find

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:45.420
your fingerprints,

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:46.780
how will you explain that?

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:47.980
Don't talk nonsense.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:48.980
Regarding theft,

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.020
I'm not an expert.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.140
But I do know

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.660
that for minors like students,

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.780
the law won't impose severe punishment.

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.580
However, your parents will be informed.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:28:59.180
No.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.420
Don't call my parents!

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:04.820
I put it in his bag.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.300
I did it.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.340
Please, I beg you.

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.060
Don't call my parents.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:10.980
I... I know I was wrong.

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:12.940
Ma'am, please.

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:13.660
Please.

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:16.660
Don't call my parents.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:18.940
What do you think?

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.260
Here, your books.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:24.900
Thank you.

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:25.380
This is the pen.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:25.940
Okay.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:31.620
A gift.

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:38.780
Thank you, Ms. Tan.

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:40.380
If you hadn't been here,

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.100
I'd have been mistaken for a thief.

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:43.580
You're welcome.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.060
Never admit anything

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.540
that we've never done.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:47.420
So don't be afraid.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:49.700
Going to class now?

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:54.980
Yes, I'm running late.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:56.580
I have a class too, and I'm also late.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:57.380
Then let's hurry!

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:57.740
Run.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:09.420
Okay, very good!

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.060
Put it down.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:13.740
Let's do another set.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.260
Listen to my command.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:17.740
Take your things.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:22.580
Alright!

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.300
After class, practice the moves

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.340
you learned today.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.740
Ms. Tan, bye-bye.

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:28.380
Bye-bye.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:32.260
Le,

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:33.580
observing the class?

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.100
Is class over?

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:36.820
Yes.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.420
My dad's stuck in traffic
and will be late picking me up.

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:41.340
From now on,

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.100
whether coming early
or finishing your class early,

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.260
you can come in
to observe anytime you want.

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.460
Want to come in and try it out?

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:50.660
Can I?

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:51.380
Of course.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.460
Ms. Tan, what is this?

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:12.380
A yoga block.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.660
They use it as an aid

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:15.500
while practicing poses.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.620
No matter what profession you train for,

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:29.660
or what special talent you pursue,

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.060
it's actually all quite tough.

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.780
When I was little, Grandma signed me up
for piano lessons,

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:37.700
and she said

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:38.860
that playing the piano is elegant,

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.340
and the piano is a social tool,
or something like that.

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:43.700
Did she say that?

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:49.700
As long as you enjoy it,

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:51.780
you won't feel tired.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.100
No wonder you're my dad's friend.

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:56.100
You both say the same things.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:31:59.300
Would you like something to drink?

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.140
Let me treat you to a beverage.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:03.340
Okay!

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:07.900
What would you like to have?

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:09.060
Sorry.

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:11.820
How about milk or cola?

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:12.980
Let's skip the milk.

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:14.460
I'm allergic to dairy since childhood.

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:15.740
A bottle of cola then.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.060
So am I.

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:18.780
Really?

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.260
I'll have cola with you.

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:20.940
Thank you.

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:21.900
You're welcome.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:22.820
Alright.

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:28.740
Ms. Tan,

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.740
when did you start learning ballet?

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:34.060
At four years old.

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:36.460
It was painful at first

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:37.380
and I cried every day.

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:39.620
After crying so much, I got used to it.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:41.780
Is learning ballet that tough?

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:45.660
If you love it, you won't feel hard.

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.020
All I see is the beauty of it.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.700
Tiptoeing and stretching your legs,

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.540
every single move looks so painful.

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:57.100
Learning piano seems easier suddenly.

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.260
People often say

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.100
one minute on stage
takes ten years of practice offstage.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.780
Learning anything can be tough.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.980
It's quite impressive

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:08.860
that you have an interest in ballet.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.220
Maybe it runs in the blood.

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:11.700
Dad.

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:22.820
You…

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:25.540
Ms. Tan treated me to a drink.

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.980
He just finished his class,

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.420
so we chatted for a bit.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:32.580
Say thank you to Ms. Tan.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:33.660
Thank you, Ms. Tan.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:34.540
You're welcome.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:36.060
If there's nothing else,
I'll be heading off.

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:37.300
Bye-bye!

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:38.420
Bye!

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.900
Drinking cola, huh?

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:42.780
Give it to me.

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:43.820
Give it here.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:45.660
I only had a little bit.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:47.620
I told you not to drink cola.

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:48.340
Go.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:53.740
Dad,

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.140
today Ren Zhexi

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.020
tried to frame me at the bookstore

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.180
by putting an unpaid pen into my bag.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.940
Why didn't you call me right away?

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.340
Many people were surrounding me.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:06.300
Fortunately, Ms. Tan was there

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:07.500
and helped me out of the situation.

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:10.420
Or I'd have been in big trouble today.

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.780
You know, your friend is pretty cool.

00:34:58.340 --> 00:34:58.940
Ms. Deng,

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.140
please help me check

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:02.180
Feng Lexuan's information
from the piano class?

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:03.620
I need to contact his parents.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:04.300
Okay,

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:04.980
I'll check it for you.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:05.500
Thank you.

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:11.540
Here it is.

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:13.580
Thanks again.

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:14.140
You're welcome.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.060
Mini Puff without milk.

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:15.740
-Thanks.
- All right.

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:16.660
Let's skip the milk.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.060
I'm allergic to dairy since childhood.

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:19.340
So am I.

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.540
So, have you been married
for a long time?

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:27.940
Yes.

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:28.340
We...

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.860
We've been together a long time.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:33.340
Just haven't had the wedding yet.

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.060
Bye-bye.

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:42.300
Bye.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.140
Has Ms. Wen left work yet?

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.700
You haven't seen each other
for a long time, right?

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:50.700
At least ten years...

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:51.580
Ten years?

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:51.780
Oh my Goodness!

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:52.420
Twelve years.

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.260
Because I've been gone for twelve years.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.380
The baby suffered
severe oxygen deprivation

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:08.620
during childbirth.

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:09.900
And it was less than

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:11.340
31 weeks of gestation.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.420
[Feng Rui]

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:18.020
Feng Rui,

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:20.300
have you known about this?

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:22.820
But why didn't you tell me

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:23.660
all these years?

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.700
Because you had chosen Wen Peiyan?

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.860
Or did you collude
with Gao Hui to deceive me?

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.880
[Date of Birth: March 24, 2011]

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:40.940
Really?

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:42.420
No wonder he repeated a grade.

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.620
How could he do this?

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:46.140
This is a bit unkind.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:47.140
It's okay.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:49.420
Fortunately, Ms. Tan was there.

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.660
Or I'd have been in big trouble.

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:55.100
She is truly beautiful and kind-hearted.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:56.940
Feng Lexuan,

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:58.180
someone's looking for you outside.

00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.100
Come with me.

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.100
If you haven't prepared your lunch box,

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.380
get them out.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:04.820
The food will be here shortly.

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:19.740
Ms. Tan.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:20.740
Le.

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:22.380
What brings you here?

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.460
Just passing by
and thought I'd say hello.

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:25.820
And I brought some pizza.

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:28.060
Miss,

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:29.700
can I have lunch with her?

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:31.060
Alright.

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:32.580
But do not leave the school.

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:33.900
Go back to our classroom after eating.

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:39.820
Is it delicious?

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:41.140
Yes.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:43.060
Eat slowly.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:47.780
Ms. Tan,

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:48.780
aren't you going to eat?

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:50.060
I've eaten.

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:55.620
By the way,

00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.060
is this yours?

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:00.740
It's my piano score.

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.340
Thank you.

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.620
I have such a forgetful habit.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.060
I knew it was yours

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.540
when I saw it in the ballet classroom.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:10.100
It's so refreshing!

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.540
My dad doesn't let me drink cola.

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:14.500
Ms. Wen lets me drink a little bit.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:17.900
Drink as much as you want today.

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:18.860
Your dad isn't here.

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:24.060
Le,

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:27.540
you call Yan

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:28.460
Ms. Wen.

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:30.900
Isn't she your mother?

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:31.900
No.

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:33.580
She's my dad's girlfriend.

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:36.460
She teaches me to play the piano.

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.660
When I was born,

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:40.100
my mom passed away.

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:42.940
Grandma said it was due to labor.

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:44.980
Ms. Tan,

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:46.420
why are you asking this?

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:51.300
Although I'm your dad's good friend,

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.220
as I was abroad for many years,

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:53.940
I thought

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.460
Yan and your dad were married.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.180
But they are going to get married.

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:00.460
It should be soon.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:02.140
Because Grandma has given

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:03.300
the family heirloom to Ms. Wen.

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:07.940
Your grandma must hope

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:10.140
she becomes your mom, right?

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:11.380
Yeah.

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.860
She has been urging them.

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.420
But my dad is sometimes so moody.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.820
I don't know what he's thinking.

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:22.900
Look at you, knowing so much already!

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:24.340
Of course.

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:26.060
Ms. Tan,

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:28.860
as my dad's good friend,

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:31.580
help me persuade him.

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:33.180
He won't listen to me.

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:36.100
As a man,

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.020
he should take initiative.

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:40.500
If he likes Ms. Wen,

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.020
he should have married her earlier.

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:46.140
I will.

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:50.300
Ms. Tan,

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:51.780
can I attend

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:53.300
your ballet class on the weekend?

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:55.220
Le,

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:56.580
recently I have

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.100
had something to take care of.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.060
I might take some time off.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:02.460
Once I'm done with it,

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.660
I'll let you know

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:05.500
and we'll meet and drink cola.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:06.380
Really?

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:07.980
Thank you.

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.380
Hope to see you again soon.

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:15.020
Eat.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:16.700
Here,

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:18.380
a napkin.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:20.740
Thank you.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:42.020
Is it delicious?

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:51.620
Are you hungry?

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:53.740
What did you have for lunch?

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.820
Ms. Tan treated me to lunch.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:58.460
We had pizza and cola.

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:01.540
Don't tell my dad.

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:03.500
Ms. Tan?

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:05.700
Yes, the teacher from the ballet class

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.380
next to the piano room.

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:13.100
Why did she meet you?

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:15.300
When I went to see her last time,

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:17.500
I left my piano score there,

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:18.820
so she sent it to me.

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.420
She brought it here for you.

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:23.940
Did you thank her?

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:26.380
It's okay. We know each other well.
