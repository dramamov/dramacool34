Don't let Ms. Tan down.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.380
First move.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.180
Plié.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.300
Start timing.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.060
Let's move to the next move.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:09.900
Demi-plié.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:10.780
Start timing.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.020
Okay.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.460
Now try it on one leg.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:21.460
Not bad.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.660
Prepare for the next move.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:23.780
Ready.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.180
Start timing.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.420
Final move.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:27.540
Begin.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.180
Okay. Time's up.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:18.500
That was really good.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.220
Quite good.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:20.660
Yes.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:21.700
Right.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:22.380
Good.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:24.580
Madam.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:28.660
Ms. Guan,

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.380
did I pass the exam?

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:30.780
Wait a moment.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:32.220
Ms. Zhuang,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.260
here are the compiled results.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:33.940
Please take a look.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.100
Congratulations.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:38.940
You passed the exam.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:42.260
But

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:43.460
this school

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.420
is not the kind of amateur school
you might think.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:46.980
To reach our standards,

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.700
you'll need to keep working hard.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:49.940
I understand. I will work hard.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:50.900
Thank you, Madam.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.500
Thank you.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:52.220
Alright.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.500
Ms. Qin will take your mom

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.020
to complete
the enrollment procedures later.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:57.980
Ms. Zhuang.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:00.500
This way.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:01.500
Ms. Tan,

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.060
I'll leave now.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:02.500
Thank you.

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:03.820
Don't just stand around here.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.260
Everyone, back to your classrooms now!

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:05.980
Congratulations.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:06.460
Keep up the good work.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:06.980
Everyone, get out of here.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.100
I told you you could do it.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.220
Feeling confident?

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:12.940
Yes.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:14.220
Madam, are you confident?

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:14.780
Yes.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.300
She really did well.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:16.750
Yeah.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.100
I knew she could pass.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:19.940
Thank you.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.860
Sir, I came

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.060
to apologize.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:25.780
Well...

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:27.780
My grandson,

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:28.940
Feng Lexuan.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.900
He got into a fight yesterday.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.420
I heard from him

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.260
that some students
were bullying other students.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.300
I said, "That can't be right."

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.220
How could

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.700
there possibly be bullying
in a school like this?

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.620
I said he was talking nonsense.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.460
I even explained it to him.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.260
Severe school bullying

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.140
can lead to criminal liability.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.780
The school could be held responsible.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.140
We will

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.300
investigate this matter thoroughly.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.260
Once the investigation is complete,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.460
I'll give you a response.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.020
But right now,

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.100
there's no evidence.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.620
So no one can draw conclusions yet.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.500
Right.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:08.940
I asked him.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.540
I said, "You claim it's bullying."

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:11.700
"Do you have proof?"

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.060
"Where is the evidence?"

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.780
He said it happened in a blind spot.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:22.820
Your school

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.700
has areas not covered
by surveillance cameras?

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.060
I heard the school gave him
a major demerit

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.300
and asked him to write a reflection.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.460
I said the reflection must be written.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.740
It needs to be a profound reflection.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.020
But

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:40.700
the major demerit...

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.140
Sir,

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.340
without evidence,

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.180
and with the matter
not yet fully investigated,

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.180
isn't this handling a bit rash?

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:30.460
Le,

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.260
your grandma is so good to you.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.340
With your grandma stepping in,

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.100
this should be resolved, right?

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.180
Probably.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.940
Bringing in a parent as backup?

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.660
Feeling guilty, are you?

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:43.580
Ren Zhexi,

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.020
you're the one who should feel guilty!

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.580
Who threw the first punch back then?

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.940
- They did.
- They did.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.180
Exactly! Look what they did to me!

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.420
You're lying!

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.220
Do you have any evidence that I'm lying?

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.660
Or did your dear grandma

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.100
find some evidence for you?

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.020
Ren Zhexi, I'm warning you,

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.380
show some respect for my grandma!

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.380
First time I've seen

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.020
someone bring their grandma
into a fight!

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.020
You're such a coward,

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:10.900
Feng Lexuan.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.140
Do you still sleep cuddling
your grandma at night?

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.020
I've heard of mama's boys.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.420
First time I'm seeing

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.740
a little boy who needs
his grandma's protection.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.020
I forgot.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.300
You don't have a mom!

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:22.900
Yeah, that's right.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:26.500
Don't!

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.620
Don't touch me!

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:29.420
Get off!

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:38.780
Ms. Hu?

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:41.460
Alright.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:41.940
Okay.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:42.940
This is really dangerous.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:43.620
Please take care of it.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:44.460
Mr. Feng,

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.020
come with me for a moment.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:48.300
Okay.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.380
You must give me an explanation.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:49.860
Right.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.020
We definitely need an explanation.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:53.620
Sir.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:55.500
Mr. Feng.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.020
You saw it yourself.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.340
The previous issue isn't resolved,

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.780
and now Le has pushed someone.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:02.660
This time

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.300
it was caught on camera.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.380
Everyone can see what happened.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:08.500
I... I know.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.340
Le was wrong to push someone this time.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:11.980
Don't worry.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.140
We will take responsibility
for our mistakes.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:15.420
Alright.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:16.540
Here's what we'll do.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:18.980
You go back for now.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:19.860
We

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.260
will do our best
to mediate this situation.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.020
The school
doesn't want this to escalate.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:24.740
I understand.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:25.740
By the way,

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.740
Ms. Gao came to see me this afternoon.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.140
She holds firm

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.220
to her view on this matter.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.540
Now Le has pushed someone.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.940
Maybe you could talk to Ms. Gao?

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.180
Don't worry.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.460
This matter

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.780
will be handled

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:43.660
fairly and justly.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:44.580
I understand.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:46.300
Understood.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.140
Alright.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:47.780
Okay.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:54.300
Thank you.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.020
Don't you want to talk about it?

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.100
I'm on your side.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.020
Don't you trust me?

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.500
What others say is one thing.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.580
I want to hear your side of the story.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.060
Did you throw the first punch?

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.220
Yes.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.900
They said I don't have a mom.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.540
That's why I hit them.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:14.860
You're back.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.340
Ms. Wen. Grandma.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.500
I'll go check on him.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.460
So that's what happened.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.900
I don't think I was wrong.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.340
Of course you weren't wrong.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.860
The fault lies with them.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:47.900
But we need to think about this.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.220
No matter the reason,

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:51.820
the moment you resort to violence,

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:52.780
the nature of the situation changes.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.060
I know.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.820
I know all that.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.300
But I was just so angry.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.980
Do you know what they said?

00:18:58.980 --> 00:18:59.300
Alright, okay.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.180
They also said I don't have a...

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.100
Forget it.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.100
I know, really.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.860
Anyway, they're the ones in the wrong.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:04.860
Let's not talk about it anymore.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:07.820
You went to the school?

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.740
And saw the principal?

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.420
Do you realize that by making a scene,

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.420
it's Le who ultimately suffers?

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.020
Making a scene?

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.340
I... I went to solve the problem.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.620
Right now, there's no evidence.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.260
The teachers' hands are tied.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.500
So without evidence,

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.620
we just have to accept the unfairness?

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.020
Besides, the principal already promised

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:31.660
he wouldn't give Le

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.380
a major demerit.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.020
You went to the school

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.140
and pressured them.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.620
Is that fair to the other students?

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:40.940
I told you.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.060
I'm trying to find evidence.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:43.900
Where is the evidence?

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:44.940
Where is it then?

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.460
By the time you find it,

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.020
it'll be too late.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:53.860
Let me tell you,

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.900
I believe Le.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.780
He doesn't go looking for trouble.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.540
That other child
must have said something

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.940
to provoke Le into hitting him.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.580
Those are two separate issues.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.540
Why are you conflating them?

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:06.700
Rui,

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.980
Le doesn't need to stay
in a school like this.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:10.980
Let's transfer him.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.660
We're trying to solve the problem,

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.300
not create new ones.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.060
Fine.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.540
Visit that boy's family
with money tomorrow.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.180
If you say Le did nothing wrong,

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.460
why should we settle with money?

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.940
Because money is the most direct
and efficient way.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.620
So you want Le to grow up

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.260
thinking money solves everything?

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.420
Stop arguing!

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:32.940
Le,

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.460
we're leaving this school.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.380
I'll find you a better one.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:37.660
Le.

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:38.020
Alright?

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:40.980
I want to

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:42.580
hear your decision.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.140
I'll go to school tomorrow
and handle it myself.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.220
Then I'll take you tomorrow.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:29.220
Is he asleep?

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:35.660
Honestly,

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.380
I don't know what to do.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.460
You don't need to worry so much.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:42.940
Let me

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:44.940
try to handle it tomorrow.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.340
How do you plan to do it?

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:52.140
I want to handle it
the way his mom would.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.300
You also think we should use money?

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:56.660
No.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.860
I think a mom

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.820
wouldn't care as much
about who was right or wrong.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.020
The most important thing would be

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.140
not wanting her child to suffer.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:09.460
Even though I've never been a mom,

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.740
I imagine that's how it would be.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:18.220
Then I...

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.380
Really, I...

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:19.780
Thank...

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.340
If I really want to
express my gratitude...

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.140
Then I'll think of

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:36.540
another way.

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:41.540
Any word from that car owner?

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.940
Not yet. I haven't received a callback.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.980
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:49.740
Bye.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:50.660
Okay. Bye.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:55.940
Just stop right here.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:56.820
Bye.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.500
Check if you've got everything.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.380
I've got it all.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:01.860
Then give me your lunchbox.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.980
Let's just pretend you forgot
your lunchbox today, alright?

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:10.540
Why?

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.900
You'll know.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:12.700
Go on in.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.700
I'll bring the lunchbox to you later.

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:15.900
Alright.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:16.980
Bye.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:17.660
Bye.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:18.780
Be careful. Watch for cars.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:19.780
Bye.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:24.540
Good morning.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:32.700
Yang Zihuan.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.660
Another paper ball.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:36.260
Look.

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:46.340
Feng Lexuan!

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:47.900
Your parent is here to see you.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:49.620
What's up?

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:50.860
Who's that?

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.180
Is that his aunt?

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:54.740
Or his...?

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.780
Don't be so forgetful next time.

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.020
Feng Lexuan's mom is so pretty.

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.500
Make sure you eat a good lunch.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.340
Feng Lexuan's mom?

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:07.900
I... I don't know.

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:08.860
So you'll have energy.

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:09.460
Okay.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.300
Go on. Back to your seat.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:11.620
Bye.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:12.220
Bye.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.980
He does have a mom.

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:16.300
Shut up.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:16.940
Yeah.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:22.980
What's she doing here?

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:23.460
Okay.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:24.420
Everyone, open your books.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:26.140
She brought me lunch.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:28.820
She brought him lunch.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.340
Turn to page forty-five.

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.700
Preview the lesson on your own.

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:43.140
Hello.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:44.220
You are...?

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.900
Hello, I'm Feng Lexuan's parent.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.140
I'm dropping something off for him.

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:51.500
I'd like to

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:52.740
take a moment of your time.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:54.860
Okay.

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:08.980
Hello.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:10.420
I'm a parent

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.180
of a student in Class 2, Grade 6
at this school.

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:15.060
On March 21st, during lunch break,

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.220
the children were playing
near the basketball court.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.260
A conflict may have occurred.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.220
The children involved received demerits.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.340
Please forgive my abruptness.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.020
I noticed your car was parked

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:26.740
facing the incident location.

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.540
Your dashcam might have recorded

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.740
what actually happened.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.020
As a parent,

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.540
I'd like to understand
the actual situation

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:36.740
to properly

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.260
guide my child.

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.620
I sincerely hope you can help

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.540
by providing the dashcam footage.

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:44.620
Thank you.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:48.380
Mrs. Ren,

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.780
I understand how you must feel.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.900
What happened yesterday
was certainly our fault.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.220
I sincerely want to

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.500
apologize to you.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:25:59.340
If

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.700
you have any requests,
please feel free to state them.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.980
We will do our best to accommodate them.

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.260
What do you mean?

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.500
You think you can just hit someone
and then offer a sweet?

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.100
That's not what I mean.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:10.900
I'm saying

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.100
we will

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:14.260
cover your child's medical
and treatment expenses.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.420
This is a small gesture from our family.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:17.780
Family?

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.020
My son said

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.620
Feng Lexuan is
from a single-parent family.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.180
Who are you?

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.020
Ms. Hu,

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.100
the impact of a child's
family background is significant.

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:29.580
An irresponsible father

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.100
letting a stepmother handle things?

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.460
No wonder the child
is always causing trouble.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.100
So

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.420
the school's emphasis
on "home-school unity"

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:38.620
makes perfect sense.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.300
Ms. Hu,

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:50.860
if we're talking about facts,

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.620
I have something to show everyone.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:14.380
What are you doing?

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.140
The truth is now clear.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.860
On behalf of the school,

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.380
I apologize to Feng Lexuan,

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.540
Duan Xiyan,

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:37.540
and Yang Zihuan.

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.180
You did nothing wrong.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:40.340
On the contrary,

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.140
Feng Lexuan, Duan Xiyan,
you stood up for a student

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.460
being bullied.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.740
You were very brave.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:46.900
The principal said

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.540
you will receive certificates
of commendation

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:49.660
at the flag-raising ceremony on Monday.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:52.380
And,

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.660
Ren Zhexi, Liu Zixin, Fu Yiwei,

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:56.580
you three

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.260
bullied others

00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:59.460
and told lies.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.260
You will each receive a major demerit.

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:02.540
In addition,

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.220
you are placed on probation.

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:05.780
If there's a next time,

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:06.620
you will be expelled!

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:07.740
Is that clear?

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.340
Alright. Let's begin class.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.260
That was satisfying.

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:16.140
Turn your math books
to page twenty-three.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:18.260
Dad,

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:19.860
let me use this to toast you.

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.860
On behalf of my classmates,
I thank you for helping clear our names.

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.020
You're welcome.

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:34.700
To your courage in standing up

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:35.380
for what's right.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:37.020
Thank you, Grandma.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.180
But next time you encounter
such a situation,

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:41.860
you need to learn
to protect yourself first.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:42.540
Right.

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:44.060
Dad,

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.300
did you sign me up

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.220
for the free combat class yet?

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.980
Are you serious about this?

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:50.380
Maybe we should
think about it some more.

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:51.660
Dad,

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.900
do you know how my classmates
praised you?

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:54.660
How?

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.420
"Feng Lexuan, your dad is super cool,

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.340
inside and out."

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:01.140
Alright.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.100
I'll sign you up
for the free combat class.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.900
Do you know
who you should be most thankful to?

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:09.300
It's Ms. Wen.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.020
She went to plead your case

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.100
with that child's mother.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:14.500
Ms. Wen,

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.340
you must have had to endure a lot.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:16.700
No.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:17.620
Not at all.

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.300
It's

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.860
thanks to your dad finding the evidence.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.820
Let me propose another toast
to both of you.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:23.620
Okay.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:24.700
Let's do it together.

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:30.300
Grandma,

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:32.980
is there anyone else I need to toast?

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.260
Can we eat now?

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.780
Alright. Let's eat.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:47.140
Today,

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:50.980
[9th Grade Model Airplane Competition]
we grandly hold the preliminary round

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.360
of the 9th School-Wide
Model Airplane Competition

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.020
on the spring campus sports field.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.620
[Waiting Area]
It aims to foster connection,

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.620
promote our friendship,

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.940
and thereby encourage the healthy
and vibrant development

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.980
of our model airplane endeavors.

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:08.220
Finally,

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.860
we wish all participants

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.660
outstanding results.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:16.220
And we wish this competition
a complete success!

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.700
[Audience Area]

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:21.300
The competition is about to
officially begin!

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:26.500
Come on!

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.420
Let's have some louder cheers, alright?

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:36.500
Go for it!

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.340
Contestant number twelve,

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:40.940
Feng Lexuan!

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:42.860
Let's hear some cheers for them!

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:48.220
Come on!

00:30:54.260 --> 00:31:03.100
Go for it!

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:06.940
I'll surpass you.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.820
Contestants, please take a short break.

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:24.340
Go for it!

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.260
Now we'll announce the results.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.860
Third place goes to

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:29.900
Xue Xiaofan!

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.140
Second place

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:34.780
goes to Feng Lexuan's team!

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:37.100
Their time is 30.11 seconds!

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:38.420
Now we'll announce...

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:39.100
We came in second.

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.460
I wanted first place.

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:42.060
Let's see who got first.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.260
Ren Zhexi's team!

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:44.980
Their time is

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:46.260
29.05 seconds!

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:46.700
Congratulations!

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:50.780
Not good enough.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.340
Go home and practice more.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.500
You can ask me if you have

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:54.820
any questions.

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:55.300
Ms. Tan.

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:56.580
Okay. Bye, Madam.

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:57.900
Qu Zhen?

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:00.300
What are you doing sitting here?

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.980
Ms. Tan, how were my moves just now?

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:08.180
You're stretching by yourself here?

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.940
Hip opening and leg stretches
are fundamental skills.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.540
You should practice them properly.

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:15.460
But

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.380
there's one thing

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:17.980
you need to pay attention to
when stretching.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:20.700
Your hips must be aligned correctly.

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.620
Many people don't notice that.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:24.460
Before my mom left,

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.500
I promised her I would practice hard.

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:29.740
Keep it up.

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.180
Should we get her shoes one size larger?

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:42.500
Sure.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:44.340
Big feet.

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:46.580
And this color, please.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:47.820
Get her two more pairs

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.620
of the genuine leather ones too.

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:51.740
Two pairs, one size larger.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:52.300
Okay.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.140
Welcome to come again.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:53.420
Okay.

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:54.020
Thank you.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.300
Thank you, Ms. Tan.

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.260
Keep dancing well.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:00.460
This doesn't make sense.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.540
How could they win?

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:07.900
You're still thinking about that?

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.140
Wasn't it just for fun?

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:13.180
Grandma, it's not just for fun.

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.540
A model airplane competition
is a science-based competition.

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:19.580
And it's not that I'm afraid
of losing or that I'm unhappy.

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:22.100
I just don't understand

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.500
why Ren Zhexi's team

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.420
ended up taking first place.

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.740
Ren Zhexi and his friends
had never built model aircraft before.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.460
They suddenly decided to
enter this competition

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:32.220
and ended up taking first place.

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:33.900
It's just too strange.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:37.780
Hello?

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.300
Feng Lexuan, major intel.

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:41.780
What intel?

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:44.300
I just heard from Ji Sen in Class 3

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:45.500
that Ren Zhexi's team

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:46.860
didn't even build
their model airplane themselves.

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.580
They didn't build it themselves?

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.460
Right. They say they bought it.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:53.940
Seems they spent a lot of money on it.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:55.780
What's the conclusion?

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:57.900
Their model airplane

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.180
wasn't built by them at all.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:01.740
They bought it.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.140
Are you allowed to buy it?

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.860
They bought it secretly.

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:08.060
The teachers didn't know.

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:10.140
I knew it.

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:11.580
The three of them?

00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:13.260
Pigs might fly.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.540
How could they?

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.740
You don't need to wear
your old shoes anymore.

00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:22.780
From now on, you can practice
in these new ones.

00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:24.140
Great.

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:32.140
The weather is nice today, isn't it?

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:34.540
Ms. Zhuang.

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:36.100
Ms. Zhuang.

00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:38.500
Qu Zhen, you went to buy shoes?

00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:39.300
Yes.

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:42.420
Look, Ms. Tan picked them for me.

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:44.860
She said they're
special soft-soled shoes for dancing.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.300
What brings you here?

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.660
Mr. Wang said he's your friend.

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:51.220
He sponsored our school today.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:52.620
I told Ms. Zhuang

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:53.340
it was because of you

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.140
that I learned
about this wonderful school.

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:58.300
Actually, I've always admired ballet,

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.220
and I've always hoped
to do something for it.

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:01.540
So thank you, Ms. Zhuang,

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:02.500
for giving me this opportunity.

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.580
On behalf of our students,

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:06.380
I thank you for your generosity.

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:07.540
You're too kind.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.700
So you're Qu Zhen?

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:11.460
Yes.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:12.300
I heard from Ms. Zhuang

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.780
that you're the first Tibetan girl

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.060
at the school to learn ballet.

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:17.780
Nice to meet you.

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:19.620
Nice to meet you too.

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:21.260
Ms. Zhuang,

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.340
may I invite Ms. Tan and Qu Zhen

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:24.220
for a meal?

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:26.420
I should be the one inviting you.

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.580
You've made
such a big contribution to our school.

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:29.380
Right?

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:31.780
Ms. Zhuang,

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:32.700
please join us.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:33.860
I won't go.

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:34.580
You go ahead.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.100
I have several students to meet.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:38.660
Do you need my help?

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:39.420
No need.

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.540
There are plenty of other teachers.

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:41.740
Besides,

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:43.460
properly thanking Mr. Wang on my behalf

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:44.660
is the most important thing.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:45.940
Alright.

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:46.780
Go ahead.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.540
Celebrate for Qu Zhen.

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:52.940
What should we eat?

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.540
Let's have pizza.

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:56.660
Is that place still open?

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.020
I've only seen pizza in magazines.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.220
I've never tried it.

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:02.740
What does it taste like?

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:03.900
You'll know once you try it.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:04.580
Let's go.

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:07.500
Yes, those two in the front.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.340
Add one more of that thing in front.

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:08.980
Are you sure?

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:10.660
That...

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.260
Kids!

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:13.220
Take it.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:13.660
Grandma.

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:14.660
Here.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.180
Well?

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:19.940
What do you think?

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:21.820
Look at the quality, Yang Zihuan.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:22.740
Look.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.620
It's not even on our level.

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.180
Can we beat them?

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:27.420
Seems like it's imported.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:29.260
Let me see!

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:30.700
Hurry!

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:31.380
Look.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:35.660
Grandma,

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.060
where did you get this?

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.380
I had it specially made for you.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:42.700
Will

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:43.900
this work?

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.060
I had a designer

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.260
from the Aerospace Academy
make this for you.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.220
Beating them won't be a problem at all.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:52.860
No.

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:54.940
The competition

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:56.740
is about building
the model airplanes ourselves.

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:57.620
Is it?

00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:58.180
But you're just

00:36:58.180 --> 00:36:59.900
giving us such a high-end one.

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.140
It's obvious the three of us
didn't make it ourselves.

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:03.580
Yeah.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.900
That's a bit like cheating.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.660
But it's already bought.

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:10.660
Wouldn't it be a waste not to use it?

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:15.420
They bought theirs,

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:16.940
but we have to make ours.

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:18.900
How is that fair?

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.860
They bought theirs,
so we should buy one too.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:23.300
And we have to beat them!

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.100
Teach those rotten kids a lesson.

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:25.820
Right?

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:26.980
But...

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:28.300
That makes sense.

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:29.340
Right?

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:30.700
Madam, you're amazing.

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:31.860
This time,

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.020
we'll really teach Ren Zhexi a lesson.

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:34.460
Look.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.140
It's so well made.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:37.500
See?

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:39.820
Is it good?

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:42.860
Qu Zhen,

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:44.660
where is your hometown?

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:46.900
My hometown is

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.500
Amu Township in Hongyuan County.

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.220
You can see
the sacred mountains from there.

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:52.500
It's very, very beautiful.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.180
There are also many lakes.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:58.620
Yaks often pass by our village.

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:00.620
It sounds beautiful.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:02.460
Being so far away,

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:03.300
do you miss home?

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:05.100
Of course I do.

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:07.340
When I saw my mom off this morning,

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:09.420
I saw tears in her eyes.

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.020
This is the first time my mom
and I have been apart.

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.620
I grew up by her side.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.340
For me, the hardest thing
about coming here

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.220
to learn ballet
is being separated from my mom.

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:23.540
Then you must study hard,

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:25.380
so you can go back
and dance for them someday.

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.340
You just need to

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.540
dance your own ballet.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:31.340
As long as

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:32.580
you feel free

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:33.180
and happy

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:33.860
while dancing ballet,

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:35.060
that's enough.

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:36.700
Okay, Ms. Tan.

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:38.300
Ms. Tan,

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:40.900
do you think I'm too old for ballet?

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:42.780
Can I dance my own ballet?

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.380
Stop joking around.

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:48.060
Yuan, just eat.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:51.500
Mr. Wang, you like Ms. Tan.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:55.660
You little rascal!

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.500
Don't call me Mr. Wang.

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:58.740
Call me Uncle Wang.

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:00.500
There's a proverb from where I'm from.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.820
"In life, there are only two things:

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.700
happiness and sorrow."

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.100
"One is spoken aloud,

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.740
the other is kept in the heart."

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:09.500
"Thousands of galloping horses

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.580
cannot exchange for true love."

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:14.420
Uncle Wang, if you like Ms. Tan,

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:16.340
you should say it bravely.

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.660
You little one, you know quite a lot.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.500
Don't talk nonsense.

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:22.540
It's not suitable to talk while eating.

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:22.820
Here.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:25.540
Try this.

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:26.580
It'll get cold soon.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.400
[Huacan! The Secret
to Leading Domestic Red Wine Sales]

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.400
[An Interview with Wang Hongyuan]

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:41.740
Sir.

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:47.860
Here is the information

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:49.460
on the wineries participating
in this red wine selection.

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:57.380
So many excellent wineries
are participating in the selection.

00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.020
Where is Cygne's brand advantage?

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.580
The winner's wine

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:03.060
will become the official wine
for the City Expo.

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:04.380
That's why

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:06.220
so many wineries are participating.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.460
Since we just won
the gold medal in France,

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:09.500
our brand recognition

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:10.820
is relatively higher

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:12.460
than most of our competitors.

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:14.260
And our taste profile
is fresher than theirs.

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:16.380
The only one
that can really compete with us

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:18.020
is probably Huacan.

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.260
Their grapes

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.660
come from the same region as ours.

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:23.580
There isn't much difference

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:24.860
from raw materials to craftsmanship.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:25.900
The difference is

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:27.980
that our red wine targets

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:29.420
a younger

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:30.460
demographic.

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:31.860
So our design

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:33.500
needs to be bolder

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:34.660
and more avant-garde.

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:36.620
That's how we
differentiate ourselves from Huacan.

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:37.780
But

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:39.700
Huacan also launched

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:41.660
two youth-oriented wines last quarter.

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:43.660
They directly target our products.

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:45.820
Are they already on the market?

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:47.780
They're available in offline stores now.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:50.540
Okay.

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:52.660
Have Hao buy some.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:53.740
I'll do a comparison.

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:54.660
Got it.

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:55.740
Also,

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:57.300
has the marketing design

00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.580
for the offline stores been updated?

00:40:59.060 --> 00:40:59.980
Don't worry.

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:01.580
It's already been updated
as you requested.

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.300
I'll send it to your email later.

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:04.220
Alright.

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:04.940
That's all.

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:05.660
Okay.

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:20.540
You may go.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:24.220
Thank you, Ms. Tan.

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.220
Thank you, Uncle Wang.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:26.420
Bye.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.300
So your grandma

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:44.420
had a really powerful airplane
made for you guys?

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:48.540
Dad,

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:51.780
I've been really conflicted about this.

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:55.140
Competitions should be fair and square.

00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:59.380
Winning with a fake

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:00.780
is worse than losing fairly.

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:03.780
But Ren Zhexi and the others
are really annoying.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:06.700
Did you see how smug they were
during practice?

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:08.900
Acting like the championship
was definitely theirs.

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.060
So you really want to beat them?

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:12.020
Of course.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.820
And you plan to use the airplane
your grandma gave you?

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:17.980
I haven't decided yet.

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.140
But Tudou and Yang Zihuan

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:21.460
are already over the moon.

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:23.460
They also think we should use

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:25.500
Grandma's awesome airplane
to teach them a lesson.

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.300
I can understand that.

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:31.500
I was thinking,

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:35.300
we don't necessarily have to
use a bought one to beat them.

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:37.420
Then what do we use?

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:38.380
Have you forgotten

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:39.900
what your dad studied in college?

00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:41.380
Right.

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:43.500
You can guide me then.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.060
That'll be a piece of cake.

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:46.100
No problem.

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:47.540
But, Le,

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:48.860
next time

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:51.180
if your grandma
does something like this,

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:54.100
you need to firmly refuse her, alright?

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:54.900
No problem.

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:57.180
But, Dad,

00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.500
you're not going to argue
with Grandma again, are you?

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:00.700
No, I won't.

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:01.700
Oh no.

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:03.060
You will argue.

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.260
It's not arguing.

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.540
It's because both your grandma
and I love you.

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:09.580
We just show it in different ways.

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:12.140
So it's inevitable we'll have

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:14.780
some disagreements
about your upbringing.

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:15.860
That's all.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:16.860
Okay.

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:20.420
Then later, you should

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:22.380
talk to Grandma

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:23.780
gently and calmly.

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:25.460
Gently and calmly? Like this?

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:26.500
"Grandma,

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:27.180
I...

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:28.300
I love you."

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:29.620
"I

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:30.540
really

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:31.580
don't..."

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:33.380
Alright.

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:34.500
We've been talking and forgot to eat.

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:36.020
But if I talk like that,

00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:37.020
your grandma definitely won't hear me.

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:38.620
The food is getting cold.

00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:39.220
Hurry up.

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:39.860
Dig in.
