The product's selling
at NT$10,000, with NT$1,000 off.

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:22.725
And there's even a 20 percent discount later.

00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:24.102
It's only a 28 percent discount in total.

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:27.484
I really don't know what's wrong
with the manufacturers.

00:02:28.757 --> 00:02:30.650
No, you do the math.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.319
Usually, they give us a 10 percent discount
with a 45 percent profit margin.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.373
Now, they're giving us a 28 percent discount,

00:02:34.373 --> 00:02:35.864
which only leaves us with a 27 percent margin.

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:37.824
But if we double the sales, we'll profit.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.382
It's our anniversary sale.

00:02:39.382 --> 00:02:42.811

00:02:44.355 --> 00:02:47.066
Yes, I know all that.

Why was I suddenly transferred
to the warehouse department?

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:11.341
- Not satisfied?
- Marketing is completely different from the warehouse.

00:03:11.341 --> 00:03:13.767
You can quit if you're not satisfied.

00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:17.031
Is it because I'm incompetent?

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:22.198
Or because I didn't go to dinner
with you and the vendors after work?

00:03:23.895 --> 00:03:26.723
Just look at you.

00:03:26.723 --> 00:03:29.167

- I just don't want that!
- It's okay.

00:16:30.698 --> 00:16:32.408
Just be good.

00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:33.893
I don't want to!

00:16:33.893 --> 00:16:36.412
Mom, please stop making a fuss! Okay?

00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:38.839
Can you just listen to the doctor
and get chemotherapy?

00:16:38.839 --> 00:16:41.157
Then you won't...

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.045
I won't die?

00:16:45.045 --> 00:16:47.207
Yeah, who says I won't die?

00:16:47.207 --> 00:16:49.415
I'm not afraid of dying.

00:16:50.217 --> 00:16:52.094
I'm not afraid of dying!

Pan Xin Tong, what are you doing?

00:17:13.007 --> 00:17:15.576
Mom.

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:18.333
I'm really tired.

00:17:19.248 --> 00:17:22.416
I just want you to be well. That's it. I'll be fine.

00:17:22.416 --> 00:17:26.169
But can you please stop wearing me out?

00:18:36.865 --> 00:18:40.536
It's nothing.

00:18:40.536 --> 00:18:42.574
It's okay now.

00:18:47.309 --> 00:18:48.961
It's okay.

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:52.304

[Certificate of Completion, Gu Hou Ze]

Dr. Gu, Ms. Zhou Xiao Qi is here.

00:19:42.306 --> 00:19:43.830
Please have a seat.

00:19:46.285 --> 00:19:49.700
We have tea, coffee, and water. Do you need anything?

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:54.466
No, I'm just here for sleeping pills.

00:19:56.044 --> 00:19:57.738
How long have you had insomnia?

00:19:57.738 --> 00:19:59.448
Just lately.

00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:00.824
What about you?

00:20:00.824 --> 00:20:04.144
I often see you feeding stray cats
in the middle of the night.

00:20:04.144 --> 00:20:06.246
Do you have insomnia, too?

00:20:06.246 --> 00:20:08.926
I didn't know a doctor could have insomnia.

00:20:08.926 --> 00:20:11.065
Is something troubling you?

00:20:15.088 --> 00:20:17.215
Has anything else special happened in your life?

00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:25.182
I don't want to hear what
you psychiatrists have to say.

00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:27.695
Just prescribe me some medicine.

00:20:29.995 --> 00:20:31.605
There must be a reason you can't sleep well.

Since you've already come to visit,

00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:36.069
it's my responsibility
to provide professional help.

00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:39.535
Let's talk. Maybe it'll help.

00:21:01.718 --> 00:21:03.541
Sure.

00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:08.107
Let's talk.

00:21:09.368 --> 00:21:12.187
May I ask what you do for a living?

Art dealing.

Do you like it?

00:21:14.856 --> 00:21:17.592
Yes, I like making money.

00:21:17.592 --> 00:21:20.193
And I'm a good storyteller.

00:21:21.738 --> 00:21:26.175
Then... what's troubling you lately?

00:21:30.497 --> 00:21:33.392
Wow.

00:21:33.392 --> 00:21:34.543
Do you like it?

00:21:34.543 --> 00:21:35.627
Yes.

00:21:35.627 --> 00:21:37.754
I'm just worried about my taste.

00:21:37.754 --> 00:21:40.048
Today is our one-year anniversary.

00:21:40.048 --> 00:21:44.011
So, I asked a female employee
to pick them out for me.

00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:46.029
Here.

00:21:46.029 --> 00:21:48.712
I hope you like it.

Thank you.

00:21:55.122 --> 00:21:59.209
I've been thinking a lot
while I was in the hospital.

00:21:59.209 --> 00:22:02.571
I've worked so hard all my life
to earn so much money.

00:22:02.571 --> 00:22:08.035
But Shu Juan and Xiao An are gone.

00:22:09.386 --> 00:22:11.396
If I'm gone, too,

00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:14.954
I'll have nothing left in this world.

00:22:14.954 --> 00:22:17.037
What a pity.

00:22:18.729 --> 00:22:22.268
Xiao Qi, I've been thinking.

00:22:25.093 --> 00:22:27.380
I'm getting old.

00:22:28.638 --> 00:22:31.171
Can you have a child for me?

00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:36.730
If we have a child, we can get married.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:40.321
Everything I have will be yours in the future.

00:22:43.201 --> 00:22:45.749
Do you plan to marry him?

00:22:47.949 --> 00:22:51.192
Rationally speaking, it's a good choice.

00:22:52.721 --> 00:22:54.623
Emotionally?

00:22:54.623 --> 00:22:56.537
Do you love him?

00:23:03.548 --> 00:23:05.500
Is love fun?

00:23:06.468 --> 00:23:09.652
Two people must love each other to be together?

00:23:11.323 --> 00:23:14.184
Each can choose what they need.

00:23:14.184 --> 00:23:16.017
Have you...

00:23:18.038 --> 00:23:20.399
decided to have his baby?

00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:22.984
Or are you unsure?

00:23:22.984 --> 00:23:25.468
- Is this question bothering you?
- We've talked too much.

00:23:25.468 --> 00:23:27.926
Are you going to prescribe the medicine?

00:23:29.966 --> 00:23:36.149
I just think that right now,
your problem can't be solved by medicine.

00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:38.706
So, you're not going to prescribe the medicine.

00:23:40.627 --> 00:23:42.838
That's fine.

00:23:42.838 --> 00:23:45.799
If you don't prescribe the medicine,
I'll get it from another clinic.

00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:48.427
Let's not waste each other's time.

Thank you.

You seek professional help,
yet you don't trust the doctor's judgment.

Who says a doctor knows me
or what I need better than I do?

00:24:08.196 --> 00:24:09.533
Not necessarily.

00:24:09.533 --> 00:24:14.053
If the doctor can help, you'll feel a lot better.

00:24:17.105 --> 00:24:19.755
You should try to trust people.

00:24:21.407 --> 00:24:24.800
How about I book your next appointment?

It's her first time here today.

It's okay.

I'm in my safe period. No need for that.

00:27:27.704 --> 00:27:30.690
Are you that afraid I'll get pregnant?

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:32.913
You don't want to marry me?

00:27:36.696 --> 00:27:39.044
We've talked about this.

I'm going for a smoke.

No.

You can't smoke if you're going to get pregnant.

00:29:01.865 --> 00:29:04.786

I believe that even now,
you still want me to succeed, don't you?

living expenses, and rent.

with you to save money.
