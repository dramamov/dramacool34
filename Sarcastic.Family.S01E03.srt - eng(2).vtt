00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.040
What book are you reading?

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.920
Let me see.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.799
Here I am.

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:55.560
War and Peace.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.319
Can you handle all those words?

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.680
Ever since your mom moved in,

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.840
she and Dad argue every day.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.159
It's like a battlefield.

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:08.800
I just want peace.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.319
My mom, you know,

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.560
she's always fussing.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.280
She keeps saying Dad's habits are bad.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.800
She doesn't want to live with him.

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.240
I've been playing peacemaker a lot.

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:23.039
Breakfast's ready.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.240
Such a big breakfast!

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.919
Who made this?

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.960
My mom.

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:27.479
Dad.

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:29.719
Mom made all this herself.

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:30.439
She bought it.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.919
Mom.

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.960
She wants Dad to eat.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.000
Sorry about that.

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:40.159
This is fine bran.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.400
You might not be used to it.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.479
Watch your words.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.400
Dad, why are you upset?

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:48.199
You think I can't tell?

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.000
She's calling me a wild boar.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.039
A mountain boar.

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.759
You—

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:54.000
It's just—

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.039
a metaphor.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.199
She means you—

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:57.360
sharp-tongued,

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.080
full of wild energy.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.800
Aren't you into rock music?

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.439
Rockers,

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:07.639
they have to be

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.080
wild, right?

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.240
If you can't smooth it over, just stop.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.840
Your cover-up is stiffer than my social ties.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.759
Your tongue is really sharp.

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.680
Must use a lot of disinfectant to brush.

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:22.199
You rinse with Mr. Muscle, don't you?

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.520
You and the alpaca at our shop

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.159
could really be good friends.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:27.520
What do you mean?

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:28.840
You just have to ask.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.159
Don't you love spitting words at people?

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.520
Alpacas spit too.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.000
You two are a perfect match.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.280
Together, you make one word.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.800
Mutual support in hardship.

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.000
Mom, Mom, Mom—

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.879
Come, listen.

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.800
The magpies are singing outside.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.759
That means today is a good day.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.919
Yes, yes, yes.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.199
Let's stop arguing and eat.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.560
What magpie?

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:48.599
It's a dove.

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:49.960
The most annoying bird.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.199
Why do you say that?

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.639
You'd burst if you didn't ask.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.560
Turns out,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.800
there really was a magpie family here.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.879
A happy magpie family lived here.

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.319
Then a dove came.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.240
It took over their nest.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.759
No place left to live.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.560
Had to stay here no matter what.

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:06.800
Why is it calling so loudly?

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.560
To the whole—

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.759
apologizing to the world.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.319
Sorry.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.280
Not accepted.

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.159
Dad, Dad, Dad—

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.879
Hurry, hurry!

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:12.879
Come back and eat.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.639
Eat this.

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:15.800
This is your favorite bread.

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:16.360
Here, here.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.120
I'll break it up in your porridge.

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:20.439
He's cursing me, isn't he?

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:23.040
Don't play dumb.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.920
I heard, by Earth's laws,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
if attacked, fighting back

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:29.959
counts as self-defense.

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:38.000
Verbal attacks don't count.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.079
Besides,

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:40.240
aren't superpowers forbidden?

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:41.759
That knife is all crooked.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.040
Who knows if you'll chop Dad

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.959
or Meng Meng?

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:52.079
Feels chilly behind me.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.079
A friend is looking for me.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.399
Well—

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:03.600
You all take your time eating.

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:04.319
Enjoy your meal.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.839
He still has friends?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.600
Friends—

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:15.680
plenty of them.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.560
This proves

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:18.480
my dad

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.279
does have some good points.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.079
Yes, yes.

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:22.839
Good points.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.600
Save those lies

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.920
for your clients.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.160
Go to work and make money.

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:51.480
Lao Meng

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:52.120
Lao Yang

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.839
How have you been lately?

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.560
Not bad, not bad, not bad.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.319
Feeling a bit irritable.

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:00.759
Well, you know,

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:02.079
I’m just doting on this little one.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.120
This is

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.839
a chameleon.

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:07.040
In English, it’s

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:08.120
“chameleon.”

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.199
Bet you haven’t seen one before.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.160
A chameleon.

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:13.000
Don’t move, don’t move, don’t move.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.680
It’s really precious.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.439
And it’s even

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:17.360
a female.

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:19.800
Yours

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.040
Why does it look different
from the ones on Animal World?

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.439
It doesn’t act the same.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.040
Acting.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.519
It’s an actor.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.720
When an actress removes her makeup,

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:30.040
can you still recognize her?

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.279
Besides,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.199
those with advanced skills

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:36.839
always have the simplest disguise.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.680
You want it to change color?

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:40.120
Change.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.279
Are you kidding me?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.759
Can it really change?

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:45.079
A chameleon

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:46.319
in its whole life

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.759
can only change color so many times.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.360
There’s a set limit.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.120
Each time it changes,

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:51.000
it loses one chance.

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:53.600
You can’t afford that, bro.

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:55.000
Look, look.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.319
This, this, this—

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:57.399
How much does this thing cost?

00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:58.279
Not expensive.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.519
Forty or fifty thousand.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:01.319
Forty or fifty thousand?

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:04.879
That’s definitely a rich person’s pet.

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:06.120
Of course.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.000
Sit, sit, sit.

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:07.759
Please, have a seat.

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:08.920
Alright.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.120
It might change soon.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.439
Just put it here,

00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:20.920
and my pet shop’s vibe

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:21.800
instantly goes up.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.079
Brightens up the place, right?

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:23.680
Yes, yes.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.240
Lao Yang,

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.399
can you lend me this chameleon

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:26.480
for a week?

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.639
Help me boost my shop’s image.

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:29.160
Sure.

00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:31.600
What do I get out of it?

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:33.720
Well,

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:34.319
one side

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:35.000
of the wall—

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:37.199
pick any three pets you like.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.519
I’ll trade three for one.

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:39.319
You won’t lose out.

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:40.800
I’m the one losing here.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.839
You trade any three pets for my chameleon.

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:45.399
It’s like trading three pairs of underwear

00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:46.360
for my trench coat.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.360
Or three Xialis

00:07:47.439 --> 00:07:48.319
for my Audi.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.040
Or three national soccer players

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:51.720
for my Messi, you know?

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:52.600
You sure talk slick.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.079
Just like my co-in-law.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.360
Alright.

00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:04.000
I’ll trade my shop’s treasure—

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:05.240
an Australian alpaca—

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:06.240
for your chameleon, one week.

00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:06.879
How’s that?

00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:11.319
Deal, deal, deal.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:12.759
So, one week.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.040
It’s settled.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.519
You know,

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.600
this thing is actually pretty cute.

00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:23.279
Lao Yang said

00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:24.920
he’s got three chameleons like this.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.519
He has three.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.759
All different colors.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.759
If one can

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.439
change into a hundred colors,

00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:31.959
then tell me,

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.159
how many color combinations for three?

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:37.679
That’s one hundred times—

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:39.960
Why am I even calculating that?

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:42.320
So you mean

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.000
you want to show me some color?

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:44.960
Three hundred million.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.279
No, don’t get me wrong.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.559
You just said it’s cute.

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:48.039
Later,

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:49.039
all three chameleons

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.000
will be brought back.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.639
Co-in-law,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.519
take them out for a walk.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.120
If I go out with three chameleons,

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:57.360
I’m the Mother of Dragons!

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.039
They’re my dragon babies.

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:00.360
Just imagine—

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.320
you’re holding them,

00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:02.679
red, green, yellow one moment,

00:09:02.799 --> 00:09:03.960
green, yellow, red the next,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.159
then yellow, red, green.

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:06.600
So impressive.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.000
Might as well open a hair salon.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.120
Dragon babies are here.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.159
Keep a good eye on them.

00:09:11.799 --> 00:09:12.679
I’m just stepping out.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.080
Where are you going?

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.480
To Lao Yang’s pet shop.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.080
Aren’t you two competitors?

00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:21.000
Now we’re partners.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.240
He left the chameleon with me.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.679
I have to take the alpaca to him.

00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:26.519
It’s the pet version of Zhaojun’s Journey.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.000
You’re cultured, little sis.

00:09:28.039 --> 00:09:28.759
You got it exactly right.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.759
I’ll be right back.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.039
Do you feel stuffy?

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.000
Let me give you some fresh air, okay?

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:48.759
Liao Kai

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.360
sold two duplex apartments this month.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.600
Let’s give a round of applause!

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:57.320
Lao Cha

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.639
Six units

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.159
Take a look

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:02.279
What makes a sales genius

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.000
If we had five Lao Chas like this

00:10:06.159 --> 00:10:07.279
we wouldn't have to worry at all

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:07.919
Keep it low-key

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:08.639
Low-key

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.480
That's right

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.480
Is it "Five Lao Cha Power"?

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.559
Speak

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:16.720
Manager

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.440
Of those six units Lao Cha sold

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.039
I showed two of them to clients

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:22.639
The clients agreed to sign with me

00:10:22.639 --> 00:10:23.360
But then Lao Cha

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.120
secretly

00:10:24.279 --> 00:10:25.320
snatched them from me

00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:27.320
Hang Hang

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.320
You're giving me too much credit

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.399
Clients

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.559
can sign with whoever they want

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.120
It's not up to me, Lao Cha

00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:35.919
But I

00:10:35.919 --> 00:10:36.440
Meng Hang

00:10:36.879 --> 00:10:38.879
Is it so hard to admit others are better?

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:40.080
Is it really that hard?

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.759
Your performance is at the bottom again

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.840
I just don't get it

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.159
You're a sales loser

00:10:46.159 --> 00:10:47.919
How dare you mess with us top sales?

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.120
That's funny

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:51.200
Enough

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.679
Here's something urgent

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.279
We just got a new

00:10:55.639 --> 00:10:56.559
tricky property

00:10:56.919 --> 00:10:57.840
In the client group

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.840
it's causing a huge stir

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:00.320
They're calling it a haunted house

00:11:00.519 --> 00:11:01.240
Has anyone here

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.240
ever dealt with haunted houses before?

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.399
Haunted house

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:28.200
I spend every day in a haunted house

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.320
It's full of ghosts even in broad daylight

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.600
Vampire boss

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.399
Clueless manager

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.240
Stingy clients

00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:40.799
Scheming coworkers

00:11:41.799 --> 00:11:43.799
And me, the scapegoat

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.120
taking the fall for the boss

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.120
I'm burning with ghostly rage

00:11:51.559 --> 00:11:53.639
Someone has to report this to HQ

00:11:56.279 --> 00:11:57.919
Who should go?

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.960
Who do we send?

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:04.120
Let's have you go

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.360
Fine

00:12:10.679 --> 00:12:11.200
What?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.120
Didn't we just say

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.279
we need to send a Stayover Tester

00:12:15.399 --> 00:12:16.440
to try out the haunted house

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:18.000
Livestream to bust the rumors

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.799
Let's see who volunteers

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:20.600
Only you

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.639
stepped up

00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:22.879
and took the lead

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.039
You're so cool

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.960
I'm just unlucky

00:12:44.799 --> 00:12:46.559
Rope always breaks at the thinnest spot

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.279
People always pick the softest persimmon

00:12:49.799 --> 00:12:50.559
Forget it

00:12:50.919 --> 00:12:52.399
Everyone calls me a sales loser

00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:53.960
I don't have the right to refuse

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:57.720
Where is it?

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.600
Give me the address

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.600
Jingjue Ancient City Community

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.000
Where's the dragon?

00:13:09.759 --> 00:13:10.840
Where's my dragon?

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.960
It's in the cage

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:14.919
Where?

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:15.799
It's not here

00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:18.440
How could that be?

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.399
Isn't this

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.639
It's gone

00:13:21.639 --> 00:13:22.600
I know it's gone

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.919
Didn't I tell you to watch it?

00:13:24.759 --> 00:13:26.000
You told me to watch the cage

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.440
The cage is still here

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.639
You're talking about the cage

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:30.519
I said dragon

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.240
Can't you hear me?

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:33.399
You said cage

00:13:33.399 --> 00:13:34.320
I said

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.840
dragon

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.200
Isn't that the same?

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.600
Where's the dragon?

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.879
Humans

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:43.759
are so fragile

00:13:43.759 --> 00:13:45.279
Where's my dragon?

00:13:45.559 --> 00:13:46.240
Where's my dragon?

00:14:13.799 --> 00:14:15.519
Such a big creature

00:14:16.679 --> 00:14:18.279
How could it just disappear?

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.840
Nonsense

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:22.279
Chameleons

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.000
change color with their environment

00:14:24.559 --> 00:14:26.279
You think it's that easy to find?

00:14:26.559 --> 00:14:27.879
They've evolved for two hundred million years

00:14:27.879 --> 00:14:29.480
Was all that evolution for nothing?

00:14:30.679 --> 00:14:31.519
So what now?

00:14:32.919 --> 00:14:33.720
I've got an idea

00:14:44.679 --> 00:14:45.360
Co-in-law, you

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.000
What are you doing?

00:14:46.039 --> 00:14:46.399
No

00:14:46.759 --> 00:14:48.600
We're just pure relatives

00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:49.240
Get lost

00:14:49.519 --> 00:14:50.519
Keep dreaming

00:14:51.559 --> 00:14:52.159
No, wait

00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:54.320
What do you mean?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:55.960
That chameleon

00:14:56.399 --> 00:14:58.440
can change with its environment, right?

00:15:00.679 --> 00:15:03.120
I'll keep changing the environment's color

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.360
That way

00:15:04.679 --> 00:15:05.679
I'll tire it out

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.519
and it'll be easy to catch

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.279
The vibe is great

00:15:13.559 --> 00:15:15.559
Too bad there's no music

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:36.840
Co-in-law

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.600
Did you forget our original goal?

00:15:39.679 --> 00:15:41.440
The music's set the mood

00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:42.440
Can't stop now

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.000
Come on

00:15:43.679 --> 00:15:44.960
I'm not that kind of person

00:16:08.039 --> 00:16:10.399
Without twenty years in nightclubs

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.000
you can't dance like this

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.759
Join in

00:16:51.919 --> 00:16:52.360
Sis

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:55.360
What's my little brother like at your place?

00:16:56.159 --> 00:16:57.480
You've never mentioned him

00:16:57.919 --> 00:16:58.600
I'm just

00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.759
curious

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:00.879
Shut up

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:06.759
Look at you.

00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:08.559
You change your face

00:17:08.559 --> 00:17:09.640
faster than a chameleon.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.880
I looked it up online.

00:17:13.519 --> 00:17:14.960
A chameleon's natural enemy is a snake.

00:17:15.279 --> 00:17:15.960
Clever me,

00:17:16.039 --> 00:17:16.880
went to the pet shop

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:18.200
and got a pet snake.

00:17:18.559 --> 00:17:20.079
I hope it scares the chameleon out.

00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:25.160
You, you, you...

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.920
Is that a noodle or a snake?

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:27.720
Noodle snake.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.759
A new breed in the pet world.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.960
Are you trying to

00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:35.640
uh,

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.880
feed the chameleon extra?

00:17:38.359 --> 00:17:38.640
No.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.319
Don't be fooled by its size.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.039
It's a local snake.

00:17:42.319 --> 00:17:43.799
The ancestors said it well.

00:17:44.079 --> 00:17:45.880
A mighty dragon can't crush a local snake.

00:17:48.079 --> 00:17:50.079
You sure have a bunch of twisted logic.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:51.519
I'm telling you,

00:17:51.799 --> 00:17:52.759
what the ancestors said

00:17:52.759 --> 00:17:53.920
makes sense.

00:17:54.559 --> 00:17:55.119
It does.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.920
But let me remind you,

00:17:57.279 --> 00:17:59.119
your local snake fell to the floor.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.720
It's gone.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.640
Where's the snake?

00:18:12.119 --> 00:18:13.880
Oh my goodness!

00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:15.440
Where did it go?

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.440
Come out, hurry!

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.279
There are nooks and crannies everywhere.

00:18:20.279 --> 00:18:22.319
How do we even find it?

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.240
Luckily,

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.200
this little noodle

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.359
is harmless and non-venomous.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.279
That's good.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.279
Are you sure?

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.319
Look,

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.079
the one on the left

00:18:37.359 --> 00:18:39.039
is the pet snake you mentioned.

00:18:39.599 --> 00:18:40.440
The one on the right

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.240
is the snake you keep.

00:18:42.839 --> 00:18:44.440
They look similar,

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.440
but they're very different.

00:18:48.319 --> 00:18:48.799
How

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.559
different?

00:18:50.359 --> 00:18:51.039
It's like

00:18:51.119 --> 00:18:53.079
the difference between a husky and a wolf.

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:54.400
They look alike,

00:18:54.519 --> 00:18:55.440
but raising them

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.160
one can wreck your door,

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.440
the other can wipe out your family.

00:19:02.839 --> 00:19:03.640
This one is

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.240
an African tree snake.

00:19:05.359 --> 00:19:06.519
It's highly venomous.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.279
One bite

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:10.480
and you're done for.

00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:12.400
Darn it.

00:19:12.799 --> 00:19:14.720
Now we're a venomous snake family.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:15.920
No way.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.000
I need to pack my bags right now.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.200
Are you going to give this house

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.319
to the snake?

00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:23.839
I have to move out fast.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.400
Or else, if it jumps out,

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.240
and bites me,

00:19:26.519 --> 00:19:27.640
I'll die right here.

00:19:28.079 --> 00:19:29.680
Then this house becomes a haunted house.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.839
I have to move out.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.079
I have to move out.

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:33.480
Go ahead, move.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:34.119
Well,

00:19:34.119 --> 00:19:34.599
move out.

00:19:35.119 --> 00:19:36.400
With all these things crawling around,

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.279
you're just going to ignore it?

00:19:37.759 --> 00:19:38.680
You know, you

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.319
Anyone who calls this a haunted house is an idiot.

00:20:02.079 --> 00:20:03.960
This is such a nice house.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.720
A house.

00:20:19.839 --> 00:20:21.680
There are no ghosts in this world.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.599
If there were ghosts,

00:20:25.759 --> 00:20:26.920
as the old saying goes,

00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:28.519
even ghosts fear the wicked.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.440
With me looking this tough,

00:20:59.319 --> 00:20:59.920
Manager.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:01.799
Where are you?

00:21:01.799 --> 00:21:02.279
I'm at

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.519
Jingjue Ancient City Community.

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:05.720
Didn't I tell you to go at night?

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.880
Why did you go during the day?

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.240
I thought I'd come early to check things out.

00:21:09.759 --> 00:21:10.720
No, manager,

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.920
please let me go back.

00:21:13.359 --> 00:21:14.720
Really, I'll do anything.

00:21:15.559 --> 00:21:16.599
Then help Lao Cha

00:21:16.599 --> 00:21:18.480
sell a few unfinished apartments in Yanjiao.

00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:20.079
No way.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.400
I can't scam people.

00:21:21.519 --> 00:21:23.000
Then stay here and be my stayover tester.

00:21:23.599 --> 00:21:25.119
Livestream for the netizens tonight.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:26.880
Otherwise,

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.880
I'll fire you.

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:29.680
Manager.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:30.559
Man—

00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.359
Snake

00:21:59.559 --> 00:22:00.440
Where is it? Where?

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.079
Where is it?

00:22:01.119 --> 00:22:01.799
It's on your foot.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:04.960
I was mistaken.

00:22:05.079 --> 00:22:05.759
It's just a shoelace.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.319
You really are...

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.160
Dark.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.039
I have another house.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.720
I'll have the tenant move out first.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.519
We'll move in there.

00:22:19.759 --> 00:22:21.039
After we outlast the snake,

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:22.079
we'll move back here.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:23.880
I checked.

00:22:24.039 --> 00:22:25.480
Snakes can live for over ten years.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.880
Looking at you,

00:22:28.079 --> 00:22:29.359
the snake might outlast you.

00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:33.599
Here they come.

00:22:35.319 --> 00:22:36.599
I was dying to get out.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:39.759
Lao Meng,

00:22:39.759 --> 00:22:40.640
you're something else.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.720
You keep such a big Buddha at home.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.279
What's with your look?

00:22:44.319 --> 00:22:45.160
It's me.

00:22:47.119 --> 00:22:48.160
Sorry, sorry.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.519
My old eyes are blurry.

00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:51.319
Young lady,

00:22:51.759 --> 00:22:52.319
what are you...

00:22:52.519 --> 00:22:54.119
Why are you sitting on the table?

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.319
I'm sitting here because

00:22:56.319 --> 00:22:58.480
someone said women can't sit at the table.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.279
I have to let my co-in-laws

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.559
sit right at the table.

00:23:02.039 --> 00:23:03.680
To show us women

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.279
have a very high status.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.960
If Wang Jie finds out we have a snake,

00:23:08.039 --> 00:23:09.640
she'll get the Owners' Committee

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.720
to kick us all out.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:12.559
Where is she?

00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:15.160
She seems to have gone to the bathroom.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:16.680
Wang Jie,

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.759
our toilet is broken.

00:23:18.759 --> 00:23:21.000
Can I use your bathroom?

00:23:21.839 --> 00:23:23.359
She really treats herself like family.

00:23:24.759 --> 00:23:26.000
What's wrong now?

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.400
I searched everywhere just now.

00:23:27.759 --> 00:23:29.000
Only the bathroom I didn't check.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.759
The snake could be in the bathroom.

00:23:31.519 --> 00:23:32.039
Really?

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.200
Go check.

00:23:37.079 --> 00:23:37.599
What now?

00:23:37.599 --> 00:23:38.960
Are you just watching?

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.519
Out, out, out!

00:23:39.519 --> 00:23:40.200
We...

00:23:41.559 --> 00:23:42.400
She won't let us look.

00:23:46.279 --> 00:23:49.000
These tiles are gorgeous.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.640
I replaced them.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.039
What's going on?

00:23:52.039 --> 00:23:53.960
Eavesdropping outside the bathroom?

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.039
You won't even let me talk.

00:24:09.599 --> 00:24:10.200
Family,

00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:14.240
I'm now at Jingjue Ancient City Community's

00:24:15.759 --> 00:24:16.519
Capital

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.440
No. 18 house.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.920
The legendary

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:21.599
haunted house.

00:24:22.559 --> 00:24:23.119
Today,

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.359
I'm going to be a Stayover Tester for one night.

00:24:24.599 --> 00:24:25.160
The goal

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.400
is to shatter those

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.680
ridiculous rumors.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.519
Nothing happened.

00:24:33.079 --> 00:24:33.759
Friends,

00:24:34.359 --> 00:24:35.200
tonight

00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:36.519
I'm sleeping right here.

00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:37.759
Let's see

00:24:37.799 --> 00:24:39.079
what will actually happen.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.079
So...

00:24:40.279 --> 00:24:40.720
So...

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.880
Darn, the battery's dead.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.440
Luckily, I brought a charger.

00:25:14.039 --> 00:25:14.640
Who's there?

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.480
No one.

00:25:28.839 --> 00:25:29.519
Hallucination.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.440
Hallucination.

00:25:33.119 --> 00:25:34.119
Definitely a hallucination.

00:26:19.839 --> 00:26:20.720
Who's there?

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.039
Snake!

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.599
You're such a pervert!

00:27:51.119 --> 00:27:51.799
Meng Hang.

00:27:55.759 --> 00:27:56.880
I rushed in

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.519
because she yelled "snake."

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.079
Then she attacked me with this weapon.

00:28:02.559 --> 00:28:03.599
It took ages to pull it out.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.960
I finally got it off.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.119
She said it broke.

00:28:09.359 --> 00:28:11.160
Your bathroom's shower rod

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.119
suddenly broke.

00:28:12.279 --> 00:28:13.079
It hit her.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.680
When I heard it,

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.599
I'd already rushed in.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.480
Officer,

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.400
it's really a misunderstanding.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.359
Just a total mix-up.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:20.799
Forget it.

00:28:22.559 --> 00:28:23.160
Co-in-laws,

00:28:23.839 --> 00:28:25.880
please help me plead with the officer.

00:28:26.079 --> 00:28:26.680
Okay.

00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:28.519
Officer,

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.599
please

00:28:29.759 --> 00:28:30.680
show some mercy.

00:28:30.759 --> 00:28:31.319
Right.

00:28:31.839 --> 00:28:32.640
He's timid.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:33.640
Could you

00:28:33.759 --> 00:28:35.359
change the execution to injection?

00:28:36.279 --> 00:28:37.559
Did I offend you?

00:28:37.559 --> 00:28:37.839
You...

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:38.359
What's wrong?

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.319
You want to torture me?

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:39.759
You...

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.680
You want me to...

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.160
Me...

00:28:41.359 --> 00:28:41.839
You two elders

00:28:41.839 --> 00:28:42.920
should stop arguing.

00:28:43.359 --> 00:28:43.960
Since

00:28:44.119 --> 00:28:45.599
Grandma Wang isn't pressing charges,

00:28:45.839 --> 00:28:46.599
I think

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.359
this matter

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.400
should end here.

00:28:49.079 --> 00:28:49.799
From now on,

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.319
please don't be so impulsive.

00:28:51.319 --> 00:28:51.799
Not impulsive.

00:28:52.039 --> 00:28:52.640
Not impulsive.

00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:53.160
Alright.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:53.839
We'll head out now.

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:54.920
Okay, goodbye.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:55.480
Sorry for the trouble.

00:28:55.599 --> 00:28:56.319
No need to see us out.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.119
Take care.

00:29:01.319 --> 00:29:02.279
What are you staring at?

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.000
We need to replace our plunger.

00:29:05.039 --> 00:29:05.599
It's not round.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:11.960
Meng Hang

00:29:12.119 --> 00:29:12.640
Meng Hang

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.200
Meng Hang

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:14.960
Meng Hang

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.359
Me

00:29:15.359 --> 00:29:16.039
It's me

00:29:16.039 --> 00:29:16.519
Meng Hang

00:29:16.599 --> 00:29:17.759
Me

00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:19.119
Meng Hang, me

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:21.720
Lili

00:29:24.279 --> 00:29:24.880
Why are you here?

00:29:25.119 --> 00:29:25.960
I was secretly watching your livestream

00:29:26.039 --> 00:29:27.039
It suddenly cut off

00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:27.640
I got worried about you

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.440
So I came to check on you

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:28.960
Let's go, quick

00:29:29.119 --> 00:29:29.759
What happened here?

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.039
This is a haunted house

00:29:31.559 --> 00:29:32.599
That room is haunted

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.319
That room

00:29:33.319 --> 00:29:34.319
Impossible

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.759
After humans die

00:29:35.759 --> 00:29:37.559
They entangle with dark energy
in a quantum state

00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:38.680
Waiting for Poincaré recurrence

00:29:38.799 --> 00:29:40.160
There are no ghosts at all

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.160
Let's go, hurry

00:29:41.599 --> 00:29:42.640
Go, quick

00:29:44.119 --> 00:29:44.519
Hurry

00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:46.960
Let me take a look

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.519
Come on, come on

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.119
Don't go

00:29:49.119 --> 00:29:49.720
Go, go, go

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.079
Quick, quick

00:29:50.359 --> 00:29:51.559
Don't go

00:29:51.559 --> 00:29:52.519
That room

00:29:56.839 --> 00:29:58.039
There's nothing there

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.279
Just now

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.279
It was right there

00:30:02.039 --> 00:30:02.799
Right there

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:04.920
This

00:30:06.279 --> 00:30:07.599
It was just right there

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.359
This

00:30:09.359 --> 00:30:09.799
Look

00:30:13.039 --> 00:30:13.839
Hold this

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:14.880
This

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.359
It's fake

00:30:19.599 --> 00:30:20.839
There's nothing here

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:21.720
See?

00:30:23.319 --> 00:30:25.119
Why would I lie to you?

00:30:29.359 --> 00:30:29.839
It's fine

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.160
I really didn't lie to you

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:32.640
It's okay

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.039
I really didn't

00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:33.799
Let's go outside and check

00:30:43.319 --> 00:30:44.720
I swear I didn't lie to you

00:30:45.319 --> 00:30:46.039
It's fine, it's fine

00:31:19.359 --> 00:31:19.680
Don't hit

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:20.440
No, no, no

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.160
Don't hit, don't hit

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:21.839
It's me

00:31:23.079 --> 00:31:24.000
It's me

00:31:24.599 --> 00:31:25.400
It's me

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.000
I'm one of us

00:31:27.599 --> 00:31:28.359
You

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.119
Why are you pretending to be a ghost here?

00:31:30.119 --> 00:31:31.400
He is, he is...

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.440
Just...

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:33.680
Meng Hang

00:31:39.079 --> 00:31:39.799
Does it look good?

00:31:41.319 --> 00:31:42.279
Lao Cha

00:31:43.599 --> 00:31:45.400
Let me explain, let me explain

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.079
I have my reasons

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.119
Here's the thing

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.519
I have a client

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.119
He likes this house

00:31:54.519 --> 00:31:54.920
But

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.920
He thinks the price is too high

00:31:56.079 --> 00:31:56.880
So he bribed me

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:57.960
Asked me to spread rumors

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.319
Saying this is a haunted house

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.279
It's a haunted house

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.559
He even promised me

00:32:01.759 --> 00:32:02.400
That...

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:02.960
He'd give me

00:32:03.119 --> 00:32:04.400
A discount on the price

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.039
Twenty percent as a kickback

00:32:06.319 --> 00:32:07.720
A little bonus

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:08.400
So

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.720
Lao Meng came to stay over

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.279
Lao Cha scared him

00:32:12.279 --> 00:32:13.160
And made him leave

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.160
Rap

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.640
That's what happened

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.240
Yeah

00:32:19.599 --> 00:32:20.559
You must be tired

00:32:20.559 --> 00:32:21.000
Of course

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:21.799
I haven't even eaten

00:32:22.119 --> 00:32:22.720
Come here

00:32:22.799 --> 00:32:23.799
I'll get you something to eat

00:32:24.039 --> 00:32:24.720
What good food?

00:32:25.039 --> 00:32:26.359
Eat my electric blast

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.079
At this point

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.359
I have to lure the snake out

00:32:38.599 --> 00:32:39.279
How do we lure it?

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.720
Snakes like to eat mice

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.440
I have a hamster at my shop

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:45.920
Lao Meng

00:32:46.559 --> 00:32:48.759
Can you hand me this box, please?

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.880
Thank you

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.759
Let's go, baby

00:32:59.559 --> 00:32:59.920
You

00:33:00.039 --> 00:33:00.839
What are you doing?

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.200
I found you have a magical ability

00:33:04.319 --> 00:33:04.839
That is

00:33:05.079 --> 00:33:06.400
You can mess things up

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.359
All over again

00:33:07.559 --> 00:33:08.119
So

00:33:08.279 --> 00:33:09.160
Anyway, soon

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.599
You'll have to release the hamster

00:33:10.759 --> 00:33:11.839
You drive me half mad

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.759
So

00:33:12.799 --> 00:33:14.640
Let me release it for you

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.599
How do you know that's Lao Cha?

00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:18.480
Earlier

00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:19.759
I met Lao Cha

00:33:20.039 --> 00:33:20.640
He has a strong

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.200
cologne scent on him

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.920
That room smelled just like it

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.440
Really? You have a sharp nose

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.000
You're absolutely insane

00:33:27.079 --> 00:33:27.599
You

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:29.759
No

00:33:30.079 --> 00:33:31.000
What's going on?

00:33:40.759 --> 00:33:41.920
Is it that serious?

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.000
It's not that bad

00:33:59.559 --> 00:34:00.039
Mom

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:01.680
At this point

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.559
Why not use superpower

00:34:03.559 --> 00:34:05.119
Make all the furniture float

00:34:05.359 --> 00:34:06.480
Wouldn't that make it easy to find?

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.719
What about those two?

00:34:11.519 --> 00:34:12.760
Let them hide in the furniture

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:13.480
Meng Hang

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:14.360
Meng Hang

00:34:16.519 --> 00:34:17.440
I think

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.159
We should do like Lao Cha

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.599
Hide in the dark

00:34:21.079 --> 00:34:22.880
Then the little animals will come out

00:34:23.599 --> 00:34:24.599
Where should we hide?

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.000
In the wardrobe

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:50.800
Mom

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:51.840
You do it.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.760
Looks like it's out of air.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.960
I finally get what "greedy snake" means.

00:35:16.599 --> 00:35:17.840
Judging by the shape,

00:35:18.559 --> 00:35:19.719
this one's a hamster,

00:35:20.039 --> 00:35:21.079
and this one's a chameleon.

00:35:22.079 --> 00:35:22.719
Darn it.

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:24.679
It's all ruined.

00:35:43.679 --> 00:35:44.360
Crashed.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.239
What are you fussing over?

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.639
To welcome the alpaca home,

00:35:48.639 --> 00:35:49.960
I made it a treat myself.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.679
How did you steal this alpaca?

00:35:52.679 --> 00:35:53.679
Steal? What do you mean?

00:35:53.679 --> 00:35:55.440
I traded for it fair and square!

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.760
Your chameleon is dead.

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.840
What did you use to trade?

00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.559
What chameleon?

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.000
That was clearly a lizard.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.960
I got two geckos

00:36:03.039 --> 00:36:03.960
and traded them for it.

00:36:06.199 --> 00:36:07.440
You and Lao Yang,

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.400
you really make a pair.

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:10.760
One lacks morals,

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.119
one lacks brains.

00:36:13.159 --> 00:36:13.920
I'm in a good mood,

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:14.760
so I won't argue.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.400
Alpaca.

00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:19.599
Come on, time to eat, alpaca.

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:29.719
Lao Yang.

00:36:30.199 --> 00:36:32.199
I'm not done with you.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.519
Bring some cumin back, too.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:43.840
This family...

00:36:44.119 --> 00:36:45.559
Dragon, snake, rat, sheep,

00:36:45.559 --> 00:36:46.679
chicken, ox, dog, rabbit—

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:49.079
all twelve zodiac animals are here.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.599
I can put up with all that.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:51.760
Living together in one home,

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:52.920
what can't I tolerate?

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:53.519
Right?

00:36:54.519 --> 00:36:55.480
Except for that one.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.360
I really can't stand him.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.400
"Beijing Night"

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:03.760
I left so much love behind.

00:37:05.159 --> 00:37:05.760
Did you hear that?

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.320
Did you hear it or not?

00:37:08.039 --> 00:37:09.079
At your age,

00:37:09.079 --> 00:37:10.239
singing such racy lyrics—

00:37:10.239 --> 00:37:11.199
have you no shame?

00:37:12.719 --> 00:37:13.480
I'm done listening.

00:37:14.079 --> 00:37:15.079
I can't just beat him to death.

00:37:15.159 --> 00:37:15.719
Right?

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.400
Gotta follow Earth's laws, don't I?

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:19.199
Yeah.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.079
Officer,

00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:27.519
I'd like to report anonymously.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.280
There's a hooligan disturbing us.

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:30.480
Okay.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.920
Please come quickly.
