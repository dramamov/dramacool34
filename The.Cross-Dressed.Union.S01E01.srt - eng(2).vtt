00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.160
Miss

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.520
It's time to pay respects.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.280
Sir

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.400
It's time for court.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.160
Your Majesty has issued a decree.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.840
Grand Secretary Rui Yu is specially granted

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.760
to marry General Nan's daughter, Nan Chenxiao.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.120
The wedding will be held on an auspicious day.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.040
A wedding, a wedding!

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.440
I heard Grand Secretary Rui Yu

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.120
is dignified and graceful.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.520
Hasn't married for so many years.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.240
Doesn't even have a bedding maid.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.000
Yes, I heard that too.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.000
This General's Tiger Daughter, Nan Chenxiao,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.560
is said to be big and fierce-looking.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.640
And has a terrible temper.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.080
Your Majesty wants Sir to marry a Tiger Daughter.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.480
Isn't that asking for trouble?

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.960
But...

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.040
She's a woman.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.720
Sir Rui, please.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.520
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.440
The Nan family has served loyally for generations.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.640
So many heroes died on the battlefield.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.720
I

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.680
do not wish to wrong the Nan family.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.920
Your Majesty's action

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.920
is truly wronging the Nan family.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.360
Court politics are unpredictable.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.720
You should know the civil-military situation.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.600
You've been my companion for fifteen years.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.680
I hope

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.840
there will be many more fifteen years.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.400
Your humble servant

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.520
will not disappoint Your Majesty.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.000
Good, good, good.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.120
The previous dynasty had a Champion Marquis.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.120
He joined the army young.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.080
After surviving the Three Kingdoms' wars,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.680
the previous emperor named him Ever-Victorious General.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.240
Young Master

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.280
Why are you here?

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.160
There's trouble at home.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.680
Is it my mother's illness?

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.960
Not Madam.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.880
It's you.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
You've been granted a marriage.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.520
You scared me.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.880
I thought it was something serious.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.480
A royal marriage?

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.120
Come with me, quickly.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.240
The eunuch with the decree is almost here.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.560
Hurry!

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.200
Let's go!

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.000
What's going on?

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.160
Hurry!

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.400
What's happening here?

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.680
This...

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.760
You haven't explained it yet.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.760
How did it become a royal marriage?

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.880
There's no time.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
After the wedding and wedding night,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.360
I'll find time to explain it all.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.960
Your Majesty commands

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.960
Grand Secretary Rui Yu of Hanlin Academy is virtuous.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.240
Filial and exemplary.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.280
I am pleased with his work.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.880
Now, General Wei Bei's daughter, Nan Chenxiao,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.080
is respectful, graceful, and wise.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.480
She is a perfect match for the Grand Secretary.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.200
To fulfill this beautiful union,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.640
and balance civil and military harmony,

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.920
I hereby arrange their marriage.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.960
They will wed on an auspicious day.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.160
By imperial decree.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.240
General Nan

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.880
General Nan

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.560
This is a marriage granted by Your Majesty.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.320
Or do you mean

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.240
you want to defy the decree?

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.560
This decree...

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.000
She really is a Tiger Daughter.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.600
Isn't this nonsense?

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.600
See?

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.360
I said it was nonsense.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.600
You dare say that?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.320
No,

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.360
I just said one thing.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.240
Father

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.680
The imperial command

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.960
cannot be defied.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.760
With the Rui family's status,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.000
even a royal order

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.760
can be negotiated.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.960
You're just a fourth-rank official.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.760
Who can you negotiate with?

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.920
I trust Your Majesty has his reasons.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.520
He won't harm me.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.880
Nor the Rui family.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.200
What about your identity?

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.240
Honestly,

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.440
just now,

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.760
I thought it over.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.040
We don't need to

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.240
be overly anxious.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.080
Think about it.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.320
Either way,

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.720
we're the groom's side.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.480
Right?

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.880
As long as we don't do

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.640
that thing,

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.800
no one will ever know.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.880
Besides,

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.720
Yu'er

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.160
has always appeared frail.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.400
That's true,

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.000
but what if something happens?

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.920
That's true.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.440
She is a Tiger Daughter, after all.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.360
What if the hungry tiger pounces?

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.320
You rascal!

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.120
Why don't you learn something decent?

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.480
I'm leaving.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.480
How do you treat your sister?

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.160
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.960
I'm in a hurry to disappear.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.840
Don't want to anger my father to death.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.720
What are you saying?

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.880
I'm done talking, wife, I'm leaving.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.560
Father

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.560
Can you stop leaving?

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.240
You're making me dizzy.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.360
How can I not be anxious?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.720
About this marriage,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.160
do you have no thoughts?

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.680
Isn't it on an auspicious day?

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.760
The date isn't set yet.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.080
There's still time.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.560
Once the date is set, it'll be too late.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.960
The scholar-officials hold sway.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.440
Rui Yu leads the Hanlin Purists.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.440
If our family appeals to Your Majesty,

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.680
to revoke the decree,

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.600
wouldn't that disgrace the Rui family?

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.400
Besides, in court,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.920
things would get even harder.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.200
So we just wait here, doing nothing?

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.800
Wait until you marry over there,

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.640
and your identity is exposed,

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.200
and our whole Nan family is executed?

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.680
Father,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.120
can you let me have some peace?

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.960
Let me think this through, please?

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.280
Father,

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.680
if Rui Yu despises me

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.880
and calls off the marriage,

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.000
Fu Lü, Fu Lü!

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.880
What are you carrying?

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.560
Madam said it's for making the wedding dress.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.640
Your mother's illness has worsened.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.720
Mother used to

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.640
recognize me as her youngest son.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.880
Now she completely thinks I'm a girl.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.480
Put that over there.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.400
Help me with something.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.520
What is it?

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.440
This...

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.920
Just go ahead and do it.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.840
No problem.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.520
I'm off.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.160
Son,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.080
do you have a plan?

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:11.440
Father,

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.040
don't worry.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.640
I'll step right on those scholar-officials' tails.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:17.760
If it doesn't blow up,

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.320
I'll make sure it does.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.160
Come out and pay your debt!

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.880
Pay up! Pay up! Pay up!

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.080
Nan Chenxiao took a hairpin from my shop.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.760
Picked a bolt of red silk from my shop.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.000
Fifteen taels of silver in total.

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:32.880
Fifty taels.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.240
I also have a horse from the Western Regions.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.560
Nan Chenxiao owes money.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.840
Go ask the Nan family for it.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.840
Why block the Rui family’s gate?

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:39.520
She said

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.360
she'll be Rui family's daughter-in-law.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.800
All her expenses are Rui family's responsibility.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.440
Father,

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.840
So brazen before the wedding!

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.040
How improper!

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:52.400
Father,

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.720
Calm down.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.800
Take care of your health.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.440
Bring me a brush.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.240
I'm going to the palace to see His Majesty.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.680
Father is heading out.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.840
You’re back just in time.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.400
Deliver a memorial to the palace for me.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.560
Submit a petition.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.080
Even if I risk my old face,

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.320
I must beg His Majesty

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.680
to revoke the decree.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.920
What happened?

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.320
This morning,

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.040
your elder brother and I went out

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.440
to buy things for your wedding.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.720
A crowd blocked our front gate.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.200
They said Nan Chenxiao bought things and owes money.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.800
They demanded our family pay.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.800
That Miss Nan is too much.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.760
Isn't she taking advantage of your good temper?

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.280
Father,

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.680
Your Majesty has reigned only a year.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.480
This is his first imperial marriage decree.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.880
If Rui family asks to revoke it,

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.240
what will he think?

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.480
How hard will it be for him?

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.760
To fulfill His Majesty's will,

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.400
we can only do our best.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.240
Reporting to Your Majesty:

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.880
Miss Nan

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.480
owes three taels of gold

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.880
and three hundred taels of silver.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.480
She told the merchants

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.160
to collect from the Rui family.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.600
What did she buy?

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.880
Jewelry, fabrics,

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.600
antiques and curios.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:20.360
Yes.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.600
And also a

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.520
fine horse from the Western Regions.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.200
Looks like Nan Chenxiao

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.160
truly is a General's Tiger Daughter.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.600
Even her steed is ready.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.560
Since that's the case,

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.800
go to Qin Tian Jian now.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.440
Set their wedding date.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.520
Pick the best day within ten days.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:38.760
Yes.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.560
When the time comes,

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.240
act decisively.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.920
Avoid further trouble.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.080
Father, make your move!

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.840
Watch closely.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:04.800
Father,

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.560
Thank you for letting me win.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:07.560
How did it go?

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.720
Did the Rui family

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.880
storm into the palace to beg for a divorce?

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:12.840
What happened?

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.120
The Rui family paid off the debt.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.000
They paid all that money?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.480
Not a single coin short.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.120
This...

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.320
Well, that's that.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.080
They paid it all.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.280
Hurry, think of another way!

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.640
If one plan fails,

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.120
I have a second.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.080
Fu Lü!

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:30.800
Come with me.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:31.560
Where to?

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.560
To stir things up.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:33.000
Let's go.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.440
Someone's coming!

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.760
Okay, go, go, go!

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.720
It's a woman.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:53.960
Wrong person.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.040
What do we do now?

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.520
We've circled around so many times.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Everyone we meet is either a servant

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.800
or an old man.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.600
Thought we'd succeed this time.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.720
Why does the Rui manor have so many people?

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:04.520
Let's go.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:05.920
Where now?

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.080
Sir.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:10.840
Lord Rui.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:11.800
Eunuch Li.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.120
You came so late.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.360
Does His Majesty urgently summon me?

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.000
I'm here to deliver His Majesty's message.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.360
Rui Yu, receive the imperial decree.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.680
After Qin Tian Jian observed the stars,

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.240
the auspicious date chosen is the ninth of September.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.840
Grand Secretary Rui Yu is granted

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.320
marriage to General Nan Hongyi's daughter,

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.160
Nan Chenxiao.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.800
All wedding items will be provided by the palace.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.760
By imperial order.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.160
It will be in just five days.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:46.800
Isn't this too rushed?

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.440
Father.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.160
Accept the decree first.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.680
I accept the decree and thank Your Majesty.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.800
Grand Secretary Rui, please wait.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.560
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.000
Go back to your residence.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.520
Then where are you going?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.720
Just going out for a walk.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.720
I'm feeling troubled.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.000
Alright, alright.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.400
The Previous Emperor

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.320
rose to power relying on the Empress Dowager's family’s military.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.120
But feared the generals would become too powerful.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.960
Their achievements threatened the throne.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.320
A secret imperial decree

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.320
was issued to search.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.960
The male heirs of several generals' families

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.200
were all exiled as slaves.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.080
Stop!

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.240
Stop!

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.280
Kneel!

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.960
Bribing officials,

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.320
disrupting the court,

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.840
multiple crimes compounded.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.320
Exiled three thousand li to the southwest.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:15.520
Take them away.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.280
You scoundrel!

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.200
Take them away.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.400
My father petitioned voluntarily,

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.600
surrendered his military command.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.480
The Previous Emperor showed mercy.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.880
He allowed my elder brother to guard the border before his coming-of-age.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.880
He cannot return to the capital without an edict.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.760
I can only disguise myself as a woman to avoid disaster.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.960
No way to serve my country, only self-pity.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.960
There are ways to help in troubled times.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.480
But from whom can I seek them?

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.200
May you have a harmonious union.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.040
Congratulations!

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:25.960
May your hearts be forever joined.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.800
Congratulations, Grand Secretary Rui!

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.800
The auspicious hour has arrived.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.000
First, bow to Heaven and Earth.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.720
Honor the heavens.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.480
A match made by fate.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.200
Second, bow to Heaven and Earth.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.880
Honor your parents.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.200
Family bonds.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.600
Love as vast as the Eastern Sea.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.520
Husband and wife bow to each other.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.320
Blessed for three lifetimes.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.000
A match blessed by Heaven.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:04.920
Miss Nan.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.280
Sorry for the trouble.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.520
The ceremony is complete.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.720
Alright, alright.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.040
May you have a harmonious union.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.880
IMPERIAL DECREE ARRIVES

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.600
GRAND SECRETARY RUI'S WEDDING

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.480
YOUR MAJESTY BESTOWS A JADE RUYI

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.400
A PAIR OF NUPTIAL CUPS

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.600
A GLASS BLOSSOM JEWEL BOX

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.800
A WHITE JADE PENDANT

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.480
BY IMPERIAL ORDER

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.240
I

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.720
accept the decree and thank Your Majesty.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.480
Grand Secretary Rui.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.560
This jade pendant

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.000
Your Majesty instructed

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.680
it is specially bestowed to you.

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.120
Why not

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.840
take this auspicious moment

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:07.560
and wear it now?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.040
It will add to the joy.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.480
And not waste Your Majesty’s kindness.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.920
A good match.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.760
Since you are here, Sir,

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.120
why not stay

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.760
and have a cup of wedding wine before leaving?

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:29.680
Alright.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.720
Thank you, everyone.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.640
Eat and drink well.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:38.880
Drink up, drink up!

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.600
Let your elder brother teach you.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.040
Drink a bit more later.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.080
As long as the groom drinks enough,

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.520
the wedding night won't be consummated.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.320
Why is that?

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.760
Why do you ask so much?

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.560
Would your elder brother harm you?

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:53.840
The groom is here!

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.240
Colleagues,

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.440
today I am getting married.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.840
Thank you all for coming.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.960
Let me offer you all a toast.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.200
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.600
Come, come, come.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.720
Let me toast you all again.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.280
Grand Secretary Rui.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.960
You've already had several drinks.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.280
Tonight is such an important day.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:19.880
If you drink too much,

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.920
it's not good.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.200
What's so bad about that?

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:24.840
Grand Secretary Rui.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.880
Don't miss your wedding night tonight!

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.680
That's right, that's right!

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:30.840
Grand Secretary Rui.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.760
No need to be so formal.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.440
Tonight is such an important day.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.600
We all understand.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.680
We won't make things hard for you.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:37.720
Right?

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.360
It's fine.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:39.920
I...

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.480
Alright, that's enough.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.680
Let's go, let's go!

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:43.880
Go, go, go.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:44.600
Elder brother.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.000
Elder Brother Rui.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.320
We should have a drink together.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.040
Yes, yes, we should drink together.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.040
Grand Secretary Rui.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.320
You shouldn't stay here.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.000
Tonight is your wedding night.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.200
Don't keep your beautiful bride waiting.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.000
I...

00:18:58.960 --> 00:18:59.920
Go quickly!

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.040
Go on!

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.520
Grand Secretary Rui.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:07.920
Good luck!

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.240
My lady.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.600
My lady.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.480
My lady.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.240
I'm here.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.200
Is he going to...

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.320
My lady

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.520
You really are quite good-looking

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.840
What are you trying to do?

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.360
Don't be shy, my lady

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.640
No

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.800
You scared me to death

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.120
As long as I drink enough

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.520
I won't have to consummate the marriage

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.720
Why isn't she here yet?

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.600
Are you hungry?

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.040
Do you want

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.480
me to get you something to eat?

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.800
You still have the mood to eat?

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.120
Grand Secretary Rui hasn't lifted my veil yet

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.600
How can I eat like this?

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:11.720
Right

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.000
Hurry up, Grand Secretary

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.560
Then next, we should

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.000
Of course, drink the nuptial wine

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.920
From now on

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.840
Please bear with me, my lady

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.320
Sorry, I...

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:25.480
Cheers

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.560
Why isn't she reacting?

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:50.480
How about

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.640
we have another drink?

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:52.840
Okay

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.720
You think you can outdrink me?

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.640
She should be down now

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.080
Still not down

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.120
Why isn't she drunk yet?

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:23.960
What's going on?

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.720
Darn it, darn it, darn it

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.680
Looks like I underestimated Rui Yu

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.160
If you won't fall

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:31.880
then I will

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.040
Why did she fall?

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.160
Such a low tolerance

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:46.720
Finally, she's down

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.800
Grand Secretary Rui

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.080
Such a little weakling

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.960
I'm exhausted from today

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.160
You act all scholarly

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.720
I'll beat you up

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.360
I'll pinch you

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.560
I'll hit you

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.120
She's not dead, is she?

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.320
Why does she look small but feel so heavy?

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.480
What is she trying to do?

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.880
Is she going to change my clothes?

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:46.680
I'm not drunk

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:57.840
This...

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.360
Born of generals

00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.640
From a general's family

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.280
Carrying a weapon

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.120
Not hard to understand, right?

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.600
Not hard to understand

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.600
I'm really not drunk

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.760
Drunk people always think they're sober

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.240
How about, Grand Secretary Rui

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.280
you get some rest early

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:23.200
Right

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.200
Everyone's tired

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.640
Let's rest early

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.440
I'll sleep on the couch

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.520
Grand Secretary Rui is frail

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.040
Maybe I should sleep on the couch

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.520
How could I accept that?

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:37.720
Stop fussing

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:38.680
It's settled

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.200
I'll sleep on the couch

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:40.920
I'll sleep on the couch

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.400
I'll sleep on the couch

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.440
I'll sleep on the couch

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:46.640
Good night, Grand Secretary

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.080
I'll sleep on the couch

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.160
Finally, everything's fine

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.240
Who are you?

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.680
I'm Liang Jin

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.120
Grand Secretary's personal maid

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.960
Here to bring sobering soup

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.080
I'm Fu Lü

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.960
They might both be asleep

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.080
Why hang the warding charm?

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.120
What if they're not asleep?

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:13.960
Go check

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:15.920
You two

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:16.880
What are you doing?

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:17.920
Eldest Young Madam

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:18.360
I...

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.440
I brought sobering soup for Grand Secretary

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.000
Miss said she wanted food

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.480
I brought her something to eat

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.960
The candles are all out

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
They must be settled

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:26.600
Don't bring it

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.480
But Grand Secretary drank so much

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.440
Won't she feel bad without sobering soup?

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.320
Why bother with sobering soup?

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.520
Drinking a lot is the point

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.880
Drinking makes things lively

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.560
That's true this time

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.760
Do I have to invite you two to leave?

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:43.360
Hurry

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.080
Go away

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.160
Yes, Eldest Young Madam

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.560
What if she tries something while I'm asleep?

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.520
I absolutely can't sleep

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.280
Sleeping with a pillow

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:33.680
Better than hugging me

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.280
Young Master

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.640
Young Master

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:07.200
You...

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.280
You're trying to scare me to death

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.760
You're trying to scare me to death

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:13.440
What time is it?

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.360
It's the hour of Chen

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:18.920
Where's the little weakling?

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.080
Where's the little weakling?

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.720
She went to court

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.160
What's this?

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.560
Rui Yu, you're back.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.400
Sister-in-law, where are you headed?

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.320
I'm just about to call Miss Nan.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.360
To teach her the rules for the tea ceremony.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.640
You came back at just the right time.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.560
Let's go together.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.960
No need to trouble you, sister-in-law.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.800
Were you both alright last night?

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.520
It was your first day of marriage.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.800
She must've been nervous.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.760
About the wedding night...

00:28:58.760 --> 00:28:59.320
Sister-in-law.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.360
Um...

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.400
Is the return gift still not ready?

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.080
I prepared it long ago.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.920
Isn't the return gift due in a couple days?

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:08.840
It's fine.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.200
Right now,

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.400
the most important thing is you and the bride.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.760
You two should make some plans soon.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:15.320
Elder Brother.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.480
Are you looking for sister-in-law for something?

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:20.080
Ah, yes, yes.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:20.840
Um, um...

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.160
Madam, where should I put my new purchase?

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.800
Just put it wherever you like.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.960
You're the most familiar with our courtyard.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.640
Find me a spot with sunlight,

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.320
but not direct sun.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.040
Spread out this wood to dry properly.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.520
Why do you have so many darn requests?

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.120
I haven't even gone to see Miss Nan yet.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.360
Stop worrying about their business.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.120
If you care, care about me instead.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.560
I ate breakfast, why am I hungry again?

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:41.960
Starve for all I care.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:42.800
Go make me something tasty.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:43.880
Rui Yu.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.280
Remember to call Miss Nan.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.160
I'm starving.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.320
I want a chicken leg.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.320
I just ate three chicken legs and I'm hungry again.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.360
Eat three more, make it six.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.800
I'm going to the study for some peace.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.640
Go announce it in our courtyard.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.080
When Miss Nan's time comes,

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.800
she'll join me to greet Father in the main hall.

00:29:59.120 --> 00:29:59.920
Yes, sir.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:00.680
Go on.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.000
The room for books

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.240
is bigger than our bedroom.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.760
