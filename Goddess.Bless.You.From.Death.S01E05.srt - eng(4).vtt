00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.840
You said the talismans and clay dolls

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.040
had to come from a shaman’s house.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.600
What if it’s a meditation retreat center?

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.880
Don’t want people knowing I’m your ex?

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.920
But what you’re doing,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.920
you’re acting like you own me.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.000
Bangkok had a seven-body murder case.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.280
The case in Phangnga,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.360
you might not be involved at all.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.480
The ghost was probably mad
I found the decapitation doll.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.680
P’Singha.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.720
Wait a moment for the X-ray results.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.120
Thanks.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.360
Don’t ever do that again.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.600
Almost died, you know.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.680
Why though?

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.080
I just wanted to help.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.200
I don’t want you getting hurt.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.800
I don’t want to see you hurt either.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.800
Thought you said you’d stay home.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.360
Why come to set?

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.920
Uh, I came because I needed to warn you.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.320
Warn?

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.920
About what?

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.280
I don’t even know what it is.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.000
But what I do know,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.440
something bad is about to happen.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.000
Because the incense pot in front of
Thao Wessuwan at your house

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:42.520
just fell on its own.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.280
It’s just an incense pot.
Why make it a big deal?

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.080
But the scaffold almost fell on you for real.

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.520
If I hadn’t come help in time,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.759
you would’ve been hurt already.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.440
Okay.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.360
I’ll give you this one.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.880
Should be nothing else now.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.680
Wait for the X-ray, then head home.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.920
Okay.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.600
Sing.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.400
You heard yet?

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.160
Heard what?

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.560
Darin got hit by a car.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.680
Still hasn’t come out of surgery.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.079
Sey.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.800
Oh, P'Sing, P'King.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.040
What happened?

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.600
I’ve got no clue.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.600
I went to calm down,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.480
waiting for the lab results at the cafeteria.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.600
Then suddenly someone started yelling,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.200
Someone got hit by a car.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.120
I went to look.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.480
And I saw,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.680
Darin was already on the ground.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.040
I was just...

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.880
shouldn’t have left him alone.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.520
You didn’t make that car hit him.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.080
He’s in the doctors’ hands now.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.360
Calm down first.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.720
Darin gets scared easily,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.040
but he’s tougher than he looks.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.400
How’s Darin?

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.720
His lung is torn.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.400
The doctor is operating now.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.200
But he’s lost a lot of blood.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.280
Any family with O-type blood?

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.240
I’m O-type.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.280
Right this way.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.840
I don’t wanna say this, but,

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.120
without King today, would’ve been bad.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.080
True.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.800
Guess I owe him for this.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.520
I’ll pay it back somehow.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.520
I thought,

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.360
Thought you were gonna snap at King.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.960
Why would I snap?

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.800
This is Darin’s life on the line.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.880
I might hate King’s guts,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.320
but I can set that aside for this.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.280
You two used to be close, didn’t you?

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.200
I can separate things.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.760
I just...

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:53.880
don’t get to decide for you.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.159
But,

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.440
when P'King offered to donate blood,

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.760
it made me...

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.800
think about the old days, us.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.360
And,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.760
you and P'King,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.600
any chance you’ll talk things out?

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.600
Right now the answer’s no.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.120
But the future, who knows.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.920
Depends on how he acts.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.720
And you?

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.960
You not mad at him anymore?

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.760
Still mad.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.960
But when I really think about it,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.440
people,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.159
you never know when they’ll be gone.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.800
I just fought with Darin today.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.200
I didn’t clear things up with him.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.320
If something happens,

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.880
I’d...

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.080
never get the chance to fix things.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.680
Watch your mouth.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.880
King already gave blood.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.720
Darin will be fine.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.400
Hello?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.680
I bought grilled pork sticky rice
for Sing and Sey, one each.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.440
Thanks.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.200
You some presenter for a pork skewers shop?

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.159
I told you to go home and rest.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.840
But Sing hasn’t eaten anything.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.880
I told you,

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.080
I’ll take care of his meals myself.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.880
Can you not nag me right now?

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.280
I’ll eat.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.240
Good.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.040
Hey, how’s Darin doing?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.880
Still in surgery.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.880
Still getting blood.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.520
Using O-type.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.360
Want me to donate too?

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.000
I’m O-type.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.400
You’re this tiny.
Who could you even give blood to?

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.400
If you faint, you’ll just trouble people.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.040
P'King.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.440
Want some juice?

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.480
No, I’m fine.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.680
Thanks.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.320
So, local police just called.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.720
They already reported Darin’s hit-and-run.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.000
Sing.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.360
You coming with me?

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.760
Yeah.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.080
It’s a traffic case.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.440
No need to use witnesses from other cases.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.799
Wait here.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:37.880
I’ll be back.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.520
You guys should head home.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.600
You’ve got work tomorrow.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.480
And you?

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.160
Going home or staying here?

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.280
I’ll stay and watch him.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.600
Then I’ll stay too.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.200
P'King,

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.160
you’re going through too much.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.320
I feel bad.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.480
Stop saying you feel bad already.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.000
Anything I can help with, I want to help.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.560
And another thing,

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.280
if forensics calls you in for a rush scene,

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.560
what are you gonna do?

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.480
Okay.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.320
Then I won’t feel bad anymore.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.720
Having someone here is good.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.200
I don’t want Darin waking up to no one.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.960
Alright.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.000
I’ll order wonton soup.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:55.960
Same as always?

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.200
- The...
- No veggies, no fried shallots.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.200
Everything extra.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.680
Thup.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.840
Want some?

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.600
I’m not hungry.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.080
You rearranged the house?

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.640
Yeah.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.680
Thanks.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.280
Thup.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.200
I’m stressed.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.880
And sleepy too.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.480
I’ll eat it tomorrow morning.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.160
Can’t eat right now.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.600
I can eat it myself then.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.720
It probably doesn’t taste good now.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.480
It’s not that I won’t eat it.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.720
I’m just not hungry right now.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.840
You’re not gonna reheat it?

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.200
You don’t like grilled
pork sticky rice, right?

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.000
I won’t buy it next time.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.720
What’s wrong with you?

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.160
You’ve been like this since the hospital.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.280
It’s nothing.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.680
No.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.640
I know you’re mad at me.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.800
What is it? Just say it.
What’d I do to you?

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.320
If Singha can’t think of anything he did wrong,

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.000
how could there be anything?

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.080
Thup.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.920
Say it nicely,

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.000
or do I have to force it out of you?

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.200
What is it? Say it.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.200
I saw the photo of you and Inspector King.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.600
Old photos. What’s the problem?

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.920
Other than being coworkers with issues,

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.080
you two had something more, didn’t you?

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.160
It was just the past.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.040
You don’t need to get involved.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.800
Just know to stay away from him.
That’s it.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.760
True.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.000
I’m just someone staying at your place.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.000
I shouldn’t have asked stuff like that.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.920
I’ll go shower.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.440
So I don’t bother you.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.120
Sey.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.080
Yeah?

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.840
When you’re with someone sick,

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.720
you gotta keep your mind steady.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.280
If you sit there sulking like this,

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.480
they can feel it, you know.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.400
I don’t even know...

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.520
what me and him really are.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.040
Friends.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.720
Exes.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.680
Or,

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.000
something in between...

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.440
friends and exes.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.600
Enough.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.080
I’m not P’Aoy or P’Chod.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.600
Don’t come to me for love advice.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.920
Fair.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.480
You’re probably the last person

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.560
I should talk to about love.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.160
It’s not that I don’t want to hear it.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.320
But I just wanna tell you,

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.080
if there’s anything you wanna say to Darin,

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.880
wait till he wakes up
and say it to him yourself.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.040
Because I missed my chance to
clear things at the right time once.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.120
Do it right.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.280
So you won’t regret it later.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.160
What are you doing, Thup?

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.800
That’s my storage-room tent.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.200
Why are you pitching a tent in the house?

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.920
Too many mosquitoes.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.600
You won’t get mad, right?

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.880
You doing this,

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.000
because you’re upset with me?

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.480
You’re overthinking, Thup.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.960
I just don’t wanna talk about the past.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.600
Why are you being so touchy?

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.760
Inspector Singha is full of himself now.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.040
I just have urgent work to send a client.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.200
So I need to focus alone.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.520
Your client wants ghost sketches?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
How would a cop like you
understand an illustrator’s job?

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.520
If you’ve got nothing else to ask,

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.720
please zip the tent for me, thanks.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.080
What’s wrong with him?

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.920
Just because I don’t eat grilled pork?

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.000
I’m heading to set.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.560
You coming?

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:18.400
Thup.

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:26.720
If he sees I didn’t eat, he’ll sulk again.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.440
We need to move fast.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.040
I’m serious, King.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.480
If you don’t close this case soon,

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.560
our whole family’s screwed.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.800
Yes, Dad.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.280
I’ll take care of it.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.120
Where’s Singha’s team digging today, Ko?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.080
Sing.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.240
Search warrant.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.400
Oh, hey.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.720
Your spiritual consultant’s not here today?

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.680
No.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.600
Why?

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.400
Nothing, just,

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.280
you two are usually glued together.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.280
And the other teams? Ready?

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.080
- Ready.
- Ready.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.520
I’ve already ordered teams to
sweep the victims’ houses we skipped.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.560
Right. And Inspector King?

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.800
I informed him.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.280
But it seems like he won’t be
joining the search today.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.680
Sorry, man.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.080
For making you come.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.720
I just want you in the field with me,

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.800
in case we see something strange,
we can talk right away.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.200
It’s fine.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.600
It’s my job anyway.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.160
And Darin’s got nurses watching him.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.320
Let’s go.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.280
Excuse me.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.480
Can you tell me about your son James?

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.560
James,

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.680
he wanted to get into engineering.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.880
Friends invited him out, but he never went.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.680
Stayed in his room all the time.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.040
And do you know,

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.120
did his friends come see him at all?

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.800
Or did he go to any strange places?

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.080
During exam prep,

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.000
James liked going to one place.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.800
After he came back,

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.880
he would chant something at night.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.880
Jetasikang.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.240
Jiterumi jittang.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.800
Jetasikang.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.720
Jiterumi jittang.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.840
Do you know,

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.600
where he liked to go make offerings?

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.760
I think it was called...

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.960
something like Santi Tham House.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.800
Mek.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.480
Sweep around the house.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.360
Got it.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.440
- Let’s go, Keng.
- Yes.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.320
P'Sing.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.880
There’s a talisman sheet stuck here.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.120
Same kind you found, right?

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.080
Exactly the same.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.560
Collect the evidence for examination.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.800
Yes.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.000
There’s gotta be a decapitation doll.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.680
- Hey, Run.
- Yes.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.040
Watch the front for me.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.960
- Got it.
- Thanks.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.400
Mek.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.840
Why’d you go down there?

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.080
Mek.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.720
Mek.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.920
P'Sing.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.400
I saw it in the water.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.800
And something felt like it
was pulling me under.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.280
You sure you didn’t just imagine it?

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.840
Bro, I didn’t imagine it.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.320
I’m telling you something
really pulled me down.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.160
If it wasn’t a ghost…

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.160
then what else could it be?

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.480
Mek, calm down. Listen to me.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.800
You just slipped and fell.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.280
Then panicked.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.880
Go rest for a bit.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.760
And once your head’s clear,

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.800
make sure the evidence
gets sent in, that’s it.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.880
Easy.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.240
Every cop here

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:17.120
seems to agree with that spiritual
consultant title you gave Thup.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.600
If it’s not too much trouble,

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.920
bring him to the scene sometimes.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.400
You too, huh?

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.600
No.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.800
I just think

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.280
if Thup can point us in the right direction,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.120
it might make our work easier.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.440
He may look quiet, but he doesn’t talk unless he wants to.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.120
If he doesn’t wanna come,
how am I supposed to drag him?

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.680
You force everyone else to work anyway.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.200
Adding Thup wouldn’t hurt, you know.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.240
Or…

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.480
that Thup stopped coming

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.760
wasn’t a day off,

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.880
but you two arguing.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.720
Well…

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.640
he asked about King.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.320
I just didn’t want to talk. That’s all.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.360
If it’s that,

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.880
I get him.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.600
Anyone would feel that way.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.360
Come on, Sey,

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.640
you’re supposed to take my side.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.120
And besides, he and I aren’t anything.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.880
Why ask about my personal stuff?

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.320
And now he’s…

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.920
mad at me again.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.600
Mm.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.680
You really think that’s all?

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.400
Yeah.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.800
It’s all just work. That’s all it is.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.120
Alright.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.800
Fine, if you say so.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.720
But I think,

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.480
still…

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.000
you should clear things with Thup properly.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.480
from what Captain Mek saw today,

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.880
I think you’ll be pushed to bring
the spiritual advisor in for a while.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.280
so what do I do?

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.960
make up with him?

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.080
well…

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.760
yeah.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:59.960
buy him something?

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.760
buy what?

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.280
what’s wrong with you?

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.480
hurt your back fighting a suspect?

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.400
don’t jinx me, man.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.760
you like this, right?

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.480
for paying respect to Pu Wes.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.200
and the rosary,

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.040
I see you wear it a lot.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.800
so why give it to me?

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.600
is it because I’m a witness?

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.960
I saw you were sulking.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.360
I’m tired of the mind games.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.800
living in the same house,

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.000
don’t want you going quiet on me.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.200
but from the way you’re acting,

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.120
Sey must’ve tricked me.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.120
who said that?

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.200
(this grilled pork is actually good.)

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.280
thought you’d leave me stressed alone.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.400
I tried making up to you
last night and this morning.

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.680
you didn’t notice?

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.480
I did.

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.560
but I wanted to see…

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.640
how far you’d try.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.760
you not telling me about King,

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.360
that’s your right.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.080
but I thought we were already close.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.840
I figured I’d…

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.800
know a bit about you.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.200
maybe I

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.640
got carried away.

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.680
held on to you too much.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.200
the reason I didn’t tell you

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.600
is because it’s all stuff

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.320
that just makes you feel bad.

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.400
but if you want to know,

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.040
I’ll tell you everything.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.680
even if none of it’s good.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.280
I met King

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.400
when I first moved to investigations.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.760
Singha,

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.000
yeah?

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.560
after I joined the force,

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.160
this is Inspector King.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.960
he’ll be working here with us.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.880
King moved into the same team.
please look after him.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.280
share whatever he needs to know.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.400
yes.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.000
at first we didn’t really get along.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:08.960
but not long after,

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.280
we clicked pretty well.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.000
from then on,

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.920
we promised each other

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.120
never to betray or leave one another,

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.320
no matter what happened.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.200
if I had to move somewhere,

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.680
you’d follow me everywhere, right?

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.560
you promised.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.800
where there’s Singha,

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.760
there’s King.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.600
you don’t have to go that detailed…

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.880
you said you wanted to know.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.600
so should I keep going?

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.480
no need to be that detailed.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.640
so…

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.800
you and Inspector King,

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.920
were you actually together?

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.760
Sing’s here. Hurry.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.920
- Hey.
- At work we’re good partners.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.280
Off work we’re close too.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.880
And…

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.440
Still feel something for Inspector King?

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.760
No.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.400
More like something stuck
inside than anything.

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.760
Sometimes I think,

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.440
If that thing didn’t happen then…

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.200
what would me and him be now.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.240
But whatever.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.120
Being alone like this,

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.200
not so bad.

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.880
Alone where?

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.160
You have me.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.680
Trust me.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.880
Whatever happened…
it’s always for the better.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.360
People can change.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.920
Except…

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.080
me wanting to stay
at your place forever.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.880
I’ll trial-work at your place.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.600
Apply to take care of it.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.520
Till you decide to take me in.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.280
Hey.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.440
Not mad anymore, right.

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.400
I’ll shower first.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.560
Supatipanno Bhagavato,

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.840
Savaka Sangho.
Sanghang namami.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.120
Shit. Again?

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.120
Damn ghost. Get out.

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.320
What the hell’s that.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.600
It’s me.

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.760
What are you doing.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.360
Masking my face.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.920
Taking care of myself
like you said.

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.600
With blackout like this,
not scared of ghosts?

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.440
Move.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.240
Yeah, scared.

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.280
Move a bit.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:03.800
Lie down.

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.400
Up early tomorrow.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.000
Sleep here?

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.360
What.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.760
Wake up.

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.600
Who’s sick here.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.720
Easy.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.680
Hurts.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:52.920
You, man…

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.320
scared the hell out of me.

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:02.640
Why not sleep in your room.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.800
This isn’t my condo.

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.440
Didn’t wanna sleep alone.

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.000
Easy, easy.

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.320
Hey.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.640
P’Singha.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:31.760
Yeah.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.600
Feeling better?

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.200
Feeling better.

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.640
Good amulet.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.320
Should thank the surgeon
who cut you open,

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.680
or give credit to the
painkillers you took.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.920
I wasn’t done.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.160
Good amulet’s fine.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.960
But without you looking after me,
would’ve been worse.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.480
Stronger meds than I thought.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:58.640
Yeah.

00:39:58.800 --> 00:39:59.960
Totally forgot.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.880
I was gonna tell you this.

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.320
When I got hit by the car,

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.800
lab results came out.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.200
Hair in the decapitation doll,

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.120
DNA doesn’t match the victim.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.960
Or any of the relatives.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.800
Hey, something this big,

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.240
why not tell me.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.680
That day I couldn’t reach you.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.920
So I rushed to see you.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:25.680
Then got chased by a ghost
till I almost died.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.240
You’re looping back
to ghosts again.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.160
I know you and P’Singha
don’t believe this stuff.

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.600
But,

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.880
I really saw it.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.800
This time I didn’t imagine it.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.400
Think about it.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.200
What would I run from
so hard that…

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.800
I got hit by a car.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.680
You just weren’t careful.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.520
But I really saw it,
P’Singha.

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:52.760
The ghost P’Darin saw,

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.360
what did it look like?

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.680
Its eyes were all white.

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:17.480
You trying to test me?

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.240
Its mouth was torn.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.840
Almost up to the ears.

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.400
Like this?

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.480
Yeah.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.200
That one.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.520
Now we can assume,

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:06.080
each victim

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.800
was chosen by birthdate.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.200
Plus the Mae Sue doll evidence

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.400
we found in each victim’s house.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.920
Except the Ekalai doll,

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.000
the one we found
in the abandoned mall.

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.080
Which I think that doll,

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.520
belongs to Khun Meen.

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.120
He was born on Saturday.

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.640
From the lab results,

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.720
the hair inside this doll

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:33.080
isn’t the victim’s.

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.160
Might be the killer’s.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.760
This case is likely
a serial murder.

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.560
With evidence we have
from Chiang Mai,

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.680
and Phang Nga.

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.720
About the ghosts
you two keep seeing,

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.800
I don’t know why it’s messing
with you.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.720
From what I understand,

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.400
I feel like this ghost

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.800
doesn’t want us finding
the decapitation doll.

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.680
Or any other evidence.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:58.400
Like it’s trying to block us.

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.400
Ghost trying to block.

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.600
Uh, Inspector,

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:03.600
do we need to put ghosts
in the report,

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:04.880
P’Khem.

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.480
Ghosts can be evidence or what.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:08.680
They can’t.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.360
But from the ghost Thup drew,

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.560
it matches everything Darin saw.

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.800
So I’m supposed to believe
this now?

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.840
After all this you still
doesn’t believe?

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.360
Never seen anything
in my life.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.560
You ever seen one?

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.160
Never.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.280
It’s okay if you still
doesn’t believe.

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.400
Just bringing our
spirit consultant back,

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.840
that already makes me happy.

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.120
You.

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.280
So what do we do next?

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.160
From the link between
these three victims,

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:52.640
we probably need to
dig deeper here.

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.760
Santi Tham House.

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.200
What’s that.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.000
Sorting by birthdate?

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:18.760
Yes.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:20.720
Simple version, drop coins
on your birthday.

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.200
Like I was born Friday,

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.280
so drop on Friday.

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:25.960
You were born Saturday.

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:29.680
Yes.

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.560
Simple like that, yeah.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.920
But in astrology,

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:36.680
each day has a different power count.

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.160
Sunday is 6.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.600
Monday is 18.

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.880
Tuesday is 8.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.480
Wednesday daytime is 17.

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.200
Wednesday nighttime is 12.

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:45.920
Thursday is 19.

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:47.600
Friday is 21.

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:49.160
And Saturday is 10.

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.480
So drop coins on your birthday,

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.120
by that day’s count.

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.280
Then one coin for each
of the other days.

00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:59.880
You get it?

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:01.600
Damn.

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.680
Inspector’s consultant
is solid.

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.200
Here.

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.000
Thanks.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.120
Hey, you.

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:42.000
You were born Saturday?

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.000
Yes.

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:46.120
I was born Saturday.

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.320
Same day as you.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.400
We’re not here to hang out.

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.520
Not looking into the victims now?

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.320
We are. Everyone.

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:01.880
Inspector gave the order.

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.000
Split up and meet back here.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.600
Thup.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:08.880
Come on.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:23.800
Ma’am.

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.760
- Yes, dear?
- Need your help.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.320
- Sure.
- Uh…

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.560
Do you know this person?

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:33.560
Oh, that’s Meen.

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.480
You know her?

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.120
Of course.

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:40.280
She used to stop by here for meals.

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.480
Then suddenly disappeared.

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:45.000
And this one?

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.240
This one…

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:49.560
Jaojorm.

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.480
He often came for the free meals here.

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.600
Then vanished. Never saw him again.

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.480
And,

00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:58.800
this one?

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.520
Oh, Kaew.

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:02.680
She used to run around near the kitchen hall.

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.680
Her house is right across the street.

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.280
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.480
And this one?

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:11.400
Hmm?

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:13.760
No idea. Never seen them.

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:14.960
Oh, really?

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.200
And this one?

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.400
This one doesn’t ring a bell either.

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.320
So,

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:30.040
almost everyone who died

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.080
had been here.

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:36.080
Everyone came here looking
for something to hold onto.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.560
Different problems.

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.680
School, family, love, all kinds.

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.880
Everyone, the master’s here.

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:17.880
Oh.

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:19.880
Hey.

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.800
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.960
You’re the young man
who visited that day.

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.480
You seemed in a rush then.

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.920
Oh, I had something urgent,
so I left quick.

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:30.200
I see.

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.480
Um…

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:34.960
Who is that?

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.480
Oh, that’s Master Aisoon.

00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:41.720
He came out to meet
his disciples.

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.960
Can I go talk to him?

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.400
- I want to pay respect.
- Hey, hey,

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.760
You can’t.

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.520
The place is closed today.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.440
And he’s not well lately.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.600
So the house is closed early.

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.320
But…

00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.560
you can still make merit, son.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.040
Green or red, either is fine.

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:02.960
Any amount.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.760
You’ll get merit the same.

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.480
Sure.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.160
Though if it’s grey,

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:13.760
the merit’s a bit bigger.

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.920
Hmm. Have you all eaten?

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.280
Yes.

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:34.800
Well, if you’re in a rush again,

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.920
I’ll have someone pack food for you.

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.080
Oh, no need.

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.080
Two packs would be good, actually.

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.400
I’ll come grab them.

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:43.560
Oh.

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.280
Go prep some food for them, okay?

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.400
Yes.

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:50.000
Bless you, dear.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.480
If you need anything, just tell me.

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.360
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:55.160
Goodbye.

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:00.560
Thup.

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:02.680
If you’re hungry, go eat outside.

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:04.960
I’m not hungry.

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.560
You, come with me first.

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:08.840
What?

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.400
- You.
- Yes?

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.280
What is this place?

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:21.280
Oh, this?

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.280
It’s the old clay kiln of Ta Khuean
and the former master.

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.400
Hasn’t been used in ages.

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.160
Come on, let’s keep going.

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:31.280
Yes.

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.600
You took case evidence home.

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.440
If Thup really turns out
to be the killer,

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:55.840
what will you do?

00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:57.760
I’ll take responsibility myself.

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.640
Thanks for trusting me.

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:04.600
Every corpse had bamboo shoots
in their stomach.

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.960
So the kitchen hall, points straight
to Santi Tham House.

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.960
Nettha Sitthang Aroopang.

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.600
It’s a chant to call spirits.

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:12.320
I ate seven,

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:14.440
so I’ll eat seven more.

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:17.200
Thup.

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:19.880
Thup, don’t go.

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:20.440
Thup

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:21.840
Action.

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.080
Okay, okay, yeah, roll it up.

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:26.400
Coming in.
(full bite, full mouth)

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:28.200
I’m full. No need for dinner.

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.560
This scene’s so hard to play.

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:33.640
Top barely remembered
his lines earlier.

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.160
(do I have to memorize too?)
It’s too hard.

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.920
(it’s the pair ring, right?)

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:43.080
We’ll have to stay close,
pressed togetherPavel.

00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:44.120
(he likes Pel Pel, huh?)
Fine.

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.440
(he likes Pel Pel, huh?)
It drops and boom, we’re pressed tight.

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.840
(let me nuzzle a bit)
