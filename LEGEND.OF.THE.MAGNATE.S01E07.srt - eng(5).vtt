[Taiyufeng]

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.759
From now on, call him Mr. Gu.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.650
Mr. Gu.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.760
He's sent here by our boss.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.920
Mr. Gu.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.480
Have you worked in a pawnshop before?

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.750
No.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.830
No?

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.640
He's a genius.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.240
Since the beginning of time,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.540
our shop has finally welcomed new rules.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.590
You all came at the right time.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.870
From now on, Mr. Gu

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.910
will be our...

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.010
Fourth Manager.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.829
Fourth Manager.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.470
Strange things happen every year,

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.400
but this year, it's more abundant.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.380
Make some room for the Fourth Manager.

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.079
Fourth Manager, please move aside.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.640
Please move a bit more.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.980
Fourth Manager, make way.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.400
Fourth Manager,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.460
please step aside.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.470
You have to deliver gifts yourself?

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.690
He's just a county magistrate.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.480
If this were in Beijing,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.750
even if those officials with red hats

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.680
came to my house,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.470
they wouldn't get to see my father

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.400
if he didn't feel like seeing them.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.730
You're the young master,

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:02.240
and I'm naturally

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.590
just an errand boy.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.180
After meeting the magistrate,

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.120
I'll know

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.750
how to survive in this place.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.150
You've seen the silver mountain over there

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.400
that vexes all the thieves, right?

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.600
I really like it.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.120
I plan to put one

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.269
in front of our shop too.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:19.930
Right here,

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.910
I'll erect

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.130
a huge silver gourd over 3 meters tall.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.630
The feng shui master told me that

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.750
the area near the city gate
has the strongest fortune.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.560
I plan to

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.020
absorb it all completely.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.800
And those buildings over there.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.800
I'll rent them too

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:35.690
to set up a large draft bank.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.159
One for deposits, one for withdrawals.

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:39.880
What's so great about the Eight Families?

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.190
Besides their draft banks,

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.250
they have nothing.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.760
My father even said that

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.240
the Li family will go all out

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.570
to make a big impression here.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.230
I think it's making a mountain
out of a molehill.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.250
Three years...

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.260
No, in 3 months,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.000
and the crowd to our shops

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.200
will reach the Eight Families' houses.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.510
What are you laughing at?

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.170
I'm smiling at your ambition.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.140
Do you not believe in me,

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.730
or do you lack confidence?

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.380
Pingyao isn't big,

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.680
but this is

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.850
the financial center of the Qing Empire.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:17.950
Your father said

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.120
to go all out.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.510
But I think even with all your efforts,

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.840
you may not be able
to shake things up here.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.920
The Eight Families of Shanxi have been
around for over 200 years.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.820
They have their own history.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.420
I'll tell you about it later.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.340
Since you've already run away,

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.670
why bother coming back?

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.440
Mr. Chang.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.750
You're awake just in time.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.010
The porridge is ready.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.600
Look.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.070
I borrowed a portable stove for you.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.450
Some chestnuts for you.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.910
And some shredded chicken.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.110
This is best for restoring your energy.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.210
I didn't make this.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.360
Ms. Chang made it.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.750
Here.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.070
Try some.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:43.550
Careful, it's hot.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:53.530
Delicious.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.860
Where did this cabinet come from?

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.480
From the government office.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.260
Surprising, isn't it?

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.310
You must be the first person

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.770
in history to be imprisoned
in such comfort.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.060
What did you trade for this?

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:16.480
Myself.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.050
What do you mean?

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.480
Wang Tiangui

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.000
gave me 30 days

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.030
to sort out his pawnshop.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.360
I've also become the first person

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.750
in history to be the fourth manager
in a pawnshop.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:31.950
But for these 30 days,

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.630
you'll have to bear
with the inconvenience.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:34.720
Thirty days?

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:36.440
That pawnshop

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.830
has Wang Tiangui helpless
over its management

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:38.970
for 30 years.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.500
How could you possibly
sort it out in 30 days?

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.960
That's fooling yourself.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.600
It's only the first day.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.430
There's still time.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.090
I can learn.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.010
Those old appraisers in the pawnshop

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.040
were trained by Wang Tiangui's father

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.100
when he was around.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.430
They won't be easy to get along with.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.240
Even

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.530
lifelong businessmen

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.480
would be helpless in there.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.600
Mr. Gu,

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.240
this is a profession

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.270
you must not take lightly.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.810
I wouldn't dare underestimate it.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.090
But as the saying goes,

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.000
"Different trades
share the same principles."

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.050
People's hearts are the same everywhere.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:12.920
Their pawnshop

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.950
just has a slightly higher counter.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:16.790
Even if it's a hard nut to crack,

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:17.870
I'll break it open.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.200
Please take a look at this, Manager.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:03.960
My eyes are blurry.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:05.950
I can't see clearly anymore.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.600
Sir,

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:09.550
what are you

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.200
trying to pawn here?

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.720
This is our family heirloom,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.310
a jade from the Shang and Zhou dynasties.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.840
My elderly mother is ill
and wants to pawn it.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.790
A family heirloom jade?

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.350
Was your home underground?

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.380
Why does it smell so strongly of soil?

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.200
What?

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:30.630
Does your pawnshop

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.490
care about where items come from?

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.320
You really think
you're the government office?

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.870
I wouldn't dare.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.870
Catching thieves is not our business.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:41.990
However,

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.320
if there's a major case
at the government office,

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.530
they'll definitely come to our pawnshop

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:48.510
to investigate.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:50.270
Sir.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.840
According to the
"Great Qing Legal Code,"

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.870
grave robbery is punishable by death.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:59.150
You have

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:00.550
good eyes.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.340
This jade piece

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.750
was acquired by
my grandfather's generation

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:04.670
back then.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.550
If I were to sell this in the capital,

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.910
it would fetch at least
several thousand taels of silver.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.730
I'm only asking for 500 taels
from your pawnshop.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.570
500 taels isn't much.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.000
But there's one problem.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.540
You claim it's from the Shang-Zhou period.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.560
Hey-

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.690
This was made this year!

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.800
You carved the jade,

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.300
heated it until red-hot,

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.550
and then threw it

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.630
into the abdomens of living cats and dogs.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:36.030
You used their vital essence

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.360
to age it artificially.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:38.440
Young man,

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.150
what you're doing

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.000
will bring bad karma.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.490
You're talking nonsense!

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.680
Seek a third opinion.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.050
If anyone says this is genuine,

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.870
you can pluck out these old eyes of mine

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.750
and step on them till they pop.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.670
Go away.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.480
I've smashed this jade for you

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.910
to prevent you from cheating others.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.080
Mr. Zhu,

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.250
if it weren't for your expertise,

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.380
I would have been completely fooled.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.150
Gu Chaofeng.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.450
You're late on your first day.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.600
Are your eyes on top of your head?

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.540
Why are you putting on airs

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.550
and pretending to be a big shot?

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:22.750
You're an appraiser,

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.630
and so am I.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.480
Why speak so harshly?

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:30.960
Well, of course.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.340
This guy

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:34.440
has never worked a day
in a pawnshop before.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.360
But he has the boss to rely on.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.680
Of course, he doesn't see us as equals.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.440
If there's anything

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.330
I, the Fourth Manager, can help with,

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:42.300
just let me know.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:55.510
Young man,

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:56.670
let me ask you.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:58.630
What does the fourth manager

00:11:58.630 --> 00:11:59.960
usually handle at work?

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:05.040
I see.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:07.360
I'd like to see

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.690
your previous years' ledgers.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.020
Where might I find them?

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.660
The ledgers aren't here.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.720
They're upstairs.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:22.790
Manager!

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.910
Pawn these for me!

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.660
Give me 500 taels of silver for them!

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.020
This blade was given to me by the Marshal.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.630
This Imperial Yellow Jacket

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.630
was bestowed upon me
by the Emperor himself.

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:42.570
I risked my life

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.550
to earn

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:44.790
these two items.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.080
I want 500 taels for them,

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.280
not a candareen less!

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.030
These two items together

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.550
aren't worth even 5 taels of silver.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:51.630
Our shop can't accept them.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.120
Perhaps

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.740
you should try another pawnshop.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.670
What did you say?

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.070
Five taels of silver?

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.270
Are you looking down on the Emperor,

00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.510
the Marshal,

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:00.870
or me?

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:01.770
No, no.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:02.670
Give it!

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.700
Give it back to me!

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.550
Don't!

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:05.770
I'll cut you in half!

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:06.960
This is my precious blade!

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.390
Fourth Manager.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.150
-Fourth Manager!
-Give it to me!

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:09.080
Fourth Manager!

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.300
Your time to shine!

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:11.480
Hand it over!

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.210
You, look at them.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:21.940
Take a good look!

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:40.370
You said you work for the Marshal.

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:41.900
May I ask what rank you hold?

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.480
My surname is Bao.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.080
I'm here in Shanxi
to collect military funds.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.430
By the Emperor's grace,

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.790
I hold a second-rank military position.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:50.550
What?

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.120
Do you want to see my red official's hat?

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.320
I've heard that under the Marshal,

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.750
there are two formidable commanders,

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.000
Sir Bao and Sir Ta.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.270
Could you be

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.960
Sir Bao Qingde?

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.860
I've long admired you.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.820
Taqibu has passed away.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.050
Currently, military funding
across the country

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.080
is not coming in promptly.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.340
The soldiers in my camp

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.560
haven't been paid for half a year.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.360
I had no choice

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.290
but to pawn this,

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.360
so my brothers in the Bao Regiment

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.820
can have something to eat.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.640
If I've offended you,

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.090
please forgive me.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.520
Only a true hero can be himself.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.610
Sir Bao, how much would you
like to pawn this for?

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:29.080
Just...

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:30.480
Just 500 taels of silver would be enough.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.600
Just 500 taels isn't enough,

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.530
it's too little.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.240
Staff, make a record.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.450
One precious blade,

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.310
and one Imperial Yellow Jacket,

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.300
pawned for 1,000 taels of silver.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.470
This...

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.520
Announce the pawn and write the receipt,

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.960
that's the rule.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.610
What's there to fuss about?

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.320
Write it.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.550
Sir Bao.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.080
These are all banknotes
from the Four Major Banks,

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.140
accepted everywhere in the country.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.360
Thank you.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:24.960
Gu Pingyuan.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.000
You...

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.390
Who do you think you are?

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.380
He asked for 500, and you gave him 1,000.

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.720
You don't care about losses, do you?

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.450
This was your job to begin with,

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:34.930
you told me to do it.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:35.720
You...

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:39.960
Someone come down here!

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:44.720
Quickly,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.840
lock him up in a room somewhere

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:47.750
so he can cool down.

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:49.610
I think he's not right in the head.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.860
You just watched him do that?

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:24.300
[Taiyufeng General Ledger]

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.430
[Seventh of the month;
A set of porcelain vases, 10 taels]

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.510
[Eighth of the month;
2 bolts of embroidery, 25 taels]

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:39.580
[Ninth of the month;
a set of red jade calculations, 15 taels]

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.230
You let him announce the pawn
at the counter.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.849
You couldn't make a decision yourself,

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:06.680
so you let an amateur decide for you.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.480
You've really become senile!

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:10.400
Exactly.

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:12.589
You've set a precedent by letting him

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:13.950
announce a pawn today.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:17.490
You won't be able to stop him
from doing anything in the future.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.980
I think the 3 of us

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.960
should pack our bedrolls

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.240
and leave while we can.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:23.349
Head manager,

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.880
we've been following you for decades.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:27.510
Whatever you say,

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:28.690
we'll do.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.270
But about resigning from this job,

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.140
is it a real resignation

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:36.200
or a strategic retreat?

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.140
Please let us know.

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:43.610
We have to nip trouble in the bud.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.580
This decision isn't mine to make,

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:46.550
it's the boss's.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.220
Notify all employees that

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.280
the pawnshop won't open tomorrow.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.320
No business will be conducted.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:57.710
We're shutting down.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:12.830
Jin, right?

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:14.880
Here, take it.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:17.200
You know,

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:19.160
you've been locked up here all day,

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.830
and nobody's brought you anything to eat.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:21.400
Well,

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:23.000
my wife made lunch.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:23.920
I couldn't finish it,

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.320
so I brought some for you.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.240
That's great.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.100
Thank you, Jin.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.720
Don't mention it.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.260
I've been

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.680
idle all day

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:33.290
and I can't eat a thing.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.830
Why have you been idle all day?

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:35.690
What happened?

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.510
The head manager

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.110
told us to put up the shutters

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.200
and stop doing business.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.260
We're closed down.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.270
He and the second and third managers

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.860
went to the boss to resign.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.560
Did they resign for good?

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.960
How would people like me know about that?

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.710
Anyway,

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.200
in this pawnshop,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.480
the three appraiser masters always

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.540
have the final say.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.010
Alright,

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.240
I'm leaving now.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:01.750
Just

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.160
don't tell anyone I gave this to you.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.110
Thank you.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.070
Doctor,

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.550
you need to

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.000
examine me thoroughly

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:30.890
for my illness,

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.440
so those gossipers

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:36.250
won't make snide remarks.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:39.640
I've married so many wives,

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.960
but it's all for nothing.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.240
From now on,

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.970
we'll take turns holding you.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:48.440
Even if you were made of stone,

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.880
we'd warm you up.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:53.440
Fan me.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:54.270
Fan me.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.350
Good.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:57.400
Boss.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:59.720
You're here.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.580
You went to work for one day,

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.200
and they've already stopped working?

are too impatient.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.590
Thank you for the compliment, Boss.

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:21.450
You think I'm complimenting you?

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.370
Didn't you ask me to be a black sheep

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:24.900
and stir things up in there?

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:26.480
Not even a day has passed

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.030
and I've nearly ruined everything.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:29.540
I think it won't take 30 days

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.470
for me to get the pawnshop in order.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.830

Although you're making excuses,

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.360
there is some truth to what you say.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:54.790
Have they resigned then?

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:00.590
I just need to nod, and it's done.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.010
But according to the rules
of this business,

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.270
you can't just quit today

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.810
and leave tomorrow.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.840
They need to find a replacement

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:15.250
and get the business in order
for the boss

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.070
before they can leave.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.030
How long will that take?

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.360
At least 20 to 30 days.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:27.430
That should be enough.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.510

Please approve their resignation.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.610
My approval

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.810
is just a matter of saying the word.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.770
But these 3 old appraisers

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.800
are important figures

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:43.880

will you keep an eye on things?

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:00.830
Of course I can't.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:02.640
But none of them

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.570
can truly leave.

and see for yourself.

such a coincidence in this world?

But it's nothing short of a miracle that

Draft banks offer loans,
and pawnshops release funds.

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:23.110
You only know how to make me
call the magistrate to arrest people.

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:24.500
This isn't how you do business.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.550
You're just waiting for your own deaths.

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:27.110
Boss.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:27.960
Boss.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.070
You shouldn't be so harsh

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:30.840
on us.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.220
If we fail now,

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:33.030
we won't be able

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:35.090
to survive in this business anymore.

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:36.770
If you keep talking like this,

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:37.700
then you're

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.760
not honoring all we've done for you.

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:41.250
Please, Boss,

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:42.710
think of all we've done for you.

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:43.110
Boss,

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:45.280
please think of all we've done for you.

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:51.610
All you've done for me...

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.360
General Bao is here

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.630
to redeem his blade
and Imperial Yellow Jacket.

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:00.090
This...

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:01.890
Go get it.

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:05.320
Gu Pingyuan handled this pawn, right?

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:09.810
General Bao says

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:11.440
he won't take his things

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.210
unless he sees Mr. Gu in person.

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:13.630
You go.

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:15.150
Shoo.

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:39.570
We've been hunters all our lives,

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:42.580
but now we're the hunted.

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.880
You all better

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.360
behave yourselves!

00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:55.630
Boss.

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:57.250
He has now

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.770
gone to Wanyuandang to find Gu Pingyuan.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.680
Do you know who he is?
