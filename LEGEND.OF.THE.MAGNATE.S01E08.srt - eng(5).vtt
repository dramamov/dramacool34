[Legend of the Magnate]

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.870
[Episode 8]

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.840
Do you know who he is?

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.229
He is the greatest warrior
of the Qing Empire,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.200
the commander of the Bao Regiment,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.789
Bao Qingde.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.350
He came here specifically

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.970
to thank Mr. Gu.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.640
He deposited all of Pingyao's

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.670
allocated funds in Wanyuan Bank.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.270
Even

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.970
the provincial governor's office
wouldn't dare

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.170
ask a single question about that money.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.430
It seems Li Baiwan

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.930
really has

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.230
put down roots in Pingyao.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.140
He should thank you three.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.210
Boss!

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.380
That wasn't our intention.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.510
Stop it.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.400
I don't care

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.130
if it was your intention or not.

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.190
It was you three

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.400
who drove him away.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.000
And this is the result.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.190
If you three

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.079
still want to stay in this business,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.560
go home,

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.740
think carefully,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.800
review your accounts thoroughly,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.860
and then come to me for verification.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.310
If you can explain

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.430
every account clearly,

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.600
I might be able
to help you think of a way out.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.240
If you can't,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.520
then go home

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.630
and be prepare to live a hard life

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.150
with your children.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.630
Like smashing soybeans on a stone slab—

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.370
it's a head-on collision.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.430
You two have turned

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.160
the entire city upside down.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.540
Not quite upside down.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.590
We just poked a hole in it.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.000
This Mr. Gu

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.560
does business the way

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.030
a general commands troops.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.750
Honestly,

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.079
I was really nervous a few days ago.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.630
We spent money renting those warehouses,

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.760
and inside were just

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.520
pots and pans

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.630
and a pile of broken water jars.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.290
It was absolutely killing me.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.770
You're absolutely right about that.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.110
Gu,

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.280
think about it.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.750
I, Bao,

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.710
risk my life on the battlefield.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.620
If someone

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.800
chops off

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.040
my head,

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.820
wouldn't your 1,000 taels

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.430
be wasted?

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.000
Say it!

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.560
Be honest with me!

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.920
General Bao, someone like you,

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.330
wearing a Imperial Yellow Jacket

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.630
and carrying a waist sword,

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.490
is worth far more than 1000 taels.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.770
Forgive me for saying this,

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.650
but if you were to die for our country,

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.390
I could take your

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.870
Imperial Yellow Jacket and waist knife

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.240
to the Marshal's camp.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.680
Even if I asked

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.430
for two or three thousand taels,

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.630
the Marshal would have to buy them back.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:48.280
Cunning!

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.159
Cunning.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.600
Very cunning indeed!

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.360
You two young fellows

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:53.830
are truly something.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.920
I can now say

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.930
I've seen true heroes

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.700
and haven't lived in vain!

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.050
Do you think...

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.920
that by stirring things up

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.790
and punching a hole in Pingyao,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.110
you can get yourself out of trouble now?

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.170
Get out of trouble?

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.850
As long as my case isn't dismissed,

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:23.750
no matter where I go,

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.150
I'll still be a criminal.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.630
If I could

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.830
get those who
got involved because of me out of this,

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.370
I wouldn't mind dying.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.590
Don't talk nonsense.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.070
If nothing else works,

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.670
come back to Beijing with me.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.470
My father may know what to do.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.800
The name Li Baiwan

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:40.960
isn't just for show.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.320
He knows so many ministers and nobles.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.530
Helping you clear your name

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.860
wouldn't be difficult.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.730
At worst...

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.650
At worst, I'd kneel and beg him.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.360
A man's dignity is worth more than gold.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.490
How can you say that?

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.120
Doing business with you

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.780
gives me great satisfaction.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.720
If you get caught by the government,

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.980
they'll send you back.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.450
You'd better keep your distance from me.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.360
Do you know who I really am?

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.680
Do you know what crimes I've committed?

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.150
Everyone who's been close to me

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.910
has already been implicated because of me.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:23.630
We should

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.120
go our separate ways

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.850
from now on.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.430
Actually,

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.190
the reason I stirred you up

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.720
to cause so much trouble was

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.930
simply so we could use each other.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.280
You could establish yourself in Shanxi,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.159
and I

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.190
could save the people

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.120
I wanted to save.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.400
That's all.

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.130
As for being friends,

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.250
I don't deserve that.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:49.720
I'll be going now,

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.360
Mr. Li Qin.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.120
Gu...

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.240
You're here.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:09.240
Come.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.360
Sit down.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.310
I came for Mr. Chang.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.700
You want that mansion, right?

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.720
Take it.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.920
I even brought the deed.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:20.880
Today,

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.260
I also helped you
foil the pawnshop's scheme.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.790
This deal
can be considered complete, right?

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.390
Complete?

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.560
Of course it is.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.870
I still have another task for you.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.730
That's not how business works.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.210
How business is done is up to me.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.180
As for Chang Si's house,

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.930
I don't want it anymore.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.070
Take back the deed.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.270
Keep it for yourself

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.600
or give it to him—

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.040
it's a reward for both of you.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:57.600
However,

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.040
I can't

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.860
release him.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.090
You still need to help me
with something else.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.720
Have you heard of

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.240
King Li's treasure?

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.370
It is said that after Li Chuang
captured the capital,

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.690
he gathered 70 million taels of silver

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.580
under the name of redemption funds.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.309
Later, his army was utterly defeated,

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:44.570
so he abandoned Chang'an

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:45.830
and fled to Hunan and Guangzhou.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.230
When passing through Shanxi,
he was pursued by the Qing army.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:50.760
To escape,

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.200
he abandoned all this silver

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.610
in a mountain valley.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.470
In that valley,

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.530
there were eight households.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.830
Stumbled upon this windfall,

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.520
they began generations
of business from then on.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.810
The Eight Families have stood firm

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:09.410
from the late Ming dynasty to today,

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:10.470
all because

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.110
they relied on King Li's Treasure.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.510
No matter what disasters came,

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.950
they could turn misfortune into fortune
with this treasure.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.950
Now I want you to get into
the Eight Families

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.710
and help me find this treasure.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.320
Look.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.750
Taiyufeng has a new manager.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.970
He looks quite young.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.850
I heard he is a close confidant
of Mr. Wang

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.370
and very capable.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.940
The boss of our bank

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.180
is personally welcoming the manager.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.590
Manager, please take a seat.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.360
Ledgers Passing!

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:12.770
[Taiyufeng General Ledger]

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:18.990
[Taiyufeng General Ledger]

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.000
The manager has checked the ledgers!

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.980
Congratulations, Boss!

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.540
As all streams flow to the sea,

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.150
you've acquired the finest talent
in the land.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.840
You can rest easy from now on.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.150
Congratulations, Boss!

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.040
Congratulations, Boss!

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.630
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:59.690
Congratulations!

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:42.840
Heizi,

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.990
where have you gone to fight?

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:45.960
Didn't Father say

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.200
not to pick fights?

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:49.960
People like me

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.200
can only fight.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.570
I'm not as clever as him.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.310
Who made you angry this time?

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.360
Taiyufeng
has a new manager starting today.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.090
Did you know?

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.030
I don't go out.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.960
How would I know?

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.300
The new manager

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.980
is Gu Pingyuan, the one our father

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.580
saved at the risk of his life.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.570
He's all dressed up and decent,

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.320
drinking with the magistrate.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.650
Looking so impressive.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.450
It's true our father saved him.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:20.970
But he also saved you guys.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.440
He... he is... he...

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:28.120
Can you stop defending him

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:28.850
all the time?

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:29.740
I just feel that

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.560
once he got rich, he changed his attitude.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.200
Our father

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.260
is still in prison.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.640
Then what do you expect him to do?

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:36.900
Break into the prison?

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.670
Heizi,

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.720
you wouldn't dare either, right?

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.570
Or should he

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.030
stay home and cry with me?

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.870
It's not as if I'm short of company.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:45.630
He's a good guy.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.090
He's great. He's the best.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.120
A fugitive, living comfortably

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.030
like a big shot,

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.000
while our father
spent his whole life helping others

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.120
and is now sitting in a cell.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.670
Come with me later to bring him food.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.730
And stop saying such foolish things.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.910
[Shixingdang]

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.670
Isn't he from Wanyuandang?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.510
The young master
of the Li family in the capital.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:13.200
Mr. Li Qin!

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.000
What is he doing here?

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.300
He's from Wanyuandang,

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:21.030
right?

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:35.870
I didn't get the chance
to congratulate you.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:36.940
Please forgive me.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:37.960
Sit down.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.990
Let me introduce everyone.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.050
This is my friend,

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.190
Mr. Li Qin, a manager

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.600
who works for Li Baiwan in the capital

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.200
and the head of Wanyuandang.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.610
This is Li Baiwan's son.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:00.720
Manager,

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.550
since we have such a distinguished guest,

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.540
shouldn't you introduce him to us?

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.150
This is the head of Wanyuandang,

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:07.790
Mr. Li Qin.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.610
And this is my boss,

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:10.360
Mr. Wang.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:11.520
Old Mr. Wang,

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.010
I've long admired you.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:14.250
You flatter me.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:15.960
I am Wang Tiangui,

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.250
and I'm not that old.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.860
What a decent young man.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.210
I heard you're the young man

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.840
who drove my pawnshop and draft bank

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.760
into the red

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.000
and thrown

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.600
the entire Pingyao

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.080
into complete chaos.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:35.240
Kid,

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.340
look around.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.360
See how these people can hardly wait

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.600
to eat you alive?

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.240
Mr. Wang,

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:43.680
I wouldn't dare.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.470
I only seek a place to stand.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:49.400
I came here
as a student to learn the trade.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.020
A student, you say?

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.320
Very well.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.840
Move this stool over

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:55.670
today,

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.030
and you'll have your place

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.390
in Pingyao.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.920
But remember,

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.560
those little tricks—

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.330
you'd better stop them, right?

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.240
Of course.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.480
I apologize if I've offended you.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.120
Please forgive me.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:11.840
From now on,

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.510
I will listen to Mr. Wang

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.680
and put an end

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.090
to all those antics.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.460
Enjoy.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.160
There's more if you need it.

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:32.260
Something interesting happened recently.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.220
Dozens of appraisers have come to Pingyao.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.350
What do you think they're here for?

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.080
Dozens of appraisers and managers

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.080
suddenly came to Pingyao,

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.200
this small county.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.080
I'm afraid

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.410
Ms. Su, the one close to you,

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:45.470
is behind it.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.390
It's my honor

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:02.790
to have you all here

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.080
in Pingyao.

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.290
Everyone present

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.420
is among the most senior

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.060
pawnshop appraisers

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.580
and draft bank managers in Shanxi.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.600
You rarely step out of your doors.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.410
A toast to you.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:30.240
Why are my family in Nanjing?

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:32.480
What's going on here?

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.350
Really?

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:34.770
What's written on yours?

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:36.360
When I left home,

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.480
everything was fine.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.240
Really?

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.590
-Yeah.
-What happened?

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.580
Who did this?

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.460
I've paid you well

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.820
to come.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.190
If you want to know how big this deal is—

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.750
well,

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.270
it's a big one.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:52.790
In business,

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:54.890
some pursue wealth,

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.200
some pursue fame.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.520
I pursue the country.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:00.470
I come from the south.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:02.320
The south?

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.670
None of you in this room

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.020
can escape

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.510
the charge of

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:09.660
colluding with the enemy.

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:15.640
Here.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.030
Here's to

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.310
this accusation.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.700
Let's drink together.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:37.790
Bro,

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.350
this woman is not simple.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:41.680
Stay away from her.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:43.170
Otherwise,

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.730
it could bring disaster
to your whole family.

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:48.190
I've wanted to tell my father
the same thing,

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:49.480
but he won't listen.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.580
What about you?

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:53.830
What about me?

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.200
You're now

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.560
the manager of Taiyufeng—

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:57.200
[Taiyufeng]

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.750
a position so many envy.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.310
Apart from the Eight Families in Hedong,

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:02.830
the most powerful in this region

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:04.420
is your Mr. Wang.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.880
So now that you've taken this post,

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.510
are you going to follow its rules

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:09.440
and start opposing me

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.880
from now on?

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.730
I'm just playing along,

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.750
nothing more.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:16.960
Why don't you

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.860
just resign your position

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.720
and come work at my Wanyuandang?

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.640
Or I could write to my father

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.000
and have the charges against you dropped.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Anyway, as long as you

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.270
remain manager here for a day,

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:27.870
I won't feel at ease for a day.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.110
Wanyuandang

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.510
doesn't want an enemy like you.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:31.270
I also don't want

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:32.270
an enemy like you.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.690
I appreciate your kind offer.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:36.640
But right now,

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.750
I still have some unfinished business.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.510
If one day
I find myself with nowhere to turn,

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.040
don't forget what you said.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.160
The country is divided in two,

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.070
and the Resistance Army
already controls half.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:53.070
Jiangnan is the wealthiest region,

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.030
but after years of war

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.040
and all its ups and downs,

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.960
even the banks and pawnshops in Nanjing

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.200
are completely gone.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.160
And there's Zhejiang,

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.640
Suzhou, Yangzhou,

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.830
Zhenjiang, Ningbo—

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.310
which of these places

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:07.810
wasn't rolling in wealth?

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.310
Now they're all barren.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.590
The Resistance Army intends

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.160
to reorganize Jiangnan's finances

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.620
and get commerce flowing,

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:18.440
but many of those skilled
in running draft banks and pawnshops

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.310
have either died or fled.

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:21.400
For a time, we couldn't find many of them.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.070
That's why I invited you here.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.830
Those of you who are willing to go south

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.000
to make a living—

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:30.790
I can help

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:33.210
send your families to Nanjing

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:34.920
and settle them properly

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.180
with absolute safety.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.900
Once you're there,

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.600
you can choose good shops

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.080
and capable assistants,

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.620
reopen the banks,
and run your own business.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.790
The initial funds
will be provided by the Resistance Army.

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.400
And your descendants
can take the imperial exams

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.920
and become officials in the south.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.070
Those who do well

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.900
might even earn a noble title.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.150
That makes some sense.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.850
In these turbulent times,

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.440
could such a good opportunity
really exist?

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.480
If it's true...

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.010
I guarantee you

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.570
that within 3 years,

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.680
money will be flowing in the south.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.890
After 3 years,

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.930
if you want to stay in the south,
you can stay,

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:11.510
and if you want to come back,

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:12.700
I can make that

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:13.510
happen too.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:17.040
[Li Mansion]

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:17.960
Why didn't you tell me about

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.720
such a major matter
as the allocated funds?

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.550
I only just received the news.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:22.680
General Bao Qingde

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.400
has given all the allocated funds
of Pingyao

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.030
to Young Master's bank—

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.490
millions of taels of military funds
every year.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.350
Those draft banks in Pingyao

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.230
are absolutely jealous.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:35.630
This kid.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:36.960
He only focuses on business

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.020
without leaving himself any way out.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.240
You yourself said

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.480
that no one in this world
gives way to others.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.500
Whether it's storefront pawning,

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.350
door-to-door pawning,

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:45.480
or clergy-oriented pawning,

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.610
without such a reputation,

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:48.480
how could anyone land a deal like this?

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.080
In ancient times, a man offered

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:49.720
1000 gold coins
to buy a horse's corpse to show sincerity.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.920
In less than a month, Young Master

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.920
achieved so much.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.180
You should praise him.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:54.440
Praise him?

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.550
This is a victorious start.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:57.480
Don't you think?

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.110
That's true.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:01.750
He hasn't been in Shanxi long

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.110
and has already made such a breakthrough.

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:04.440
It's truly remarkable.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.040
Can I say this

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.550
to Young Master?

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:09.490
Don't praise your own people.

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.330
Any other news from Shanxi?

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.680
Young Master wrote that that Gu fellow

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.200
has already returned to the pawnshop.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.730
They've each settled
in their positions now.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:26.400
How should we

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:27.830
reply to Young Master?

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.460
Write back and tell him

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.180
that friends in business

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.070
are the least trustworthy people

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.250
in the world.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.000
Boss.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:43.820
Forgive me.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:46.830
How does it feel to be

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.310
the manager of Taiyufeng?

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.070
My position is precarious.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.350
I just perform whatever role

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.510
you assign me.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.110
Are you

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.110
interested in Chang Si's daughter?

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.270
How could you say that?

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.160
What's my status now?

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.270
And what's hers?

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.670
How could I be interested in her?

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.880
It doesn't matter if you are.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.160
You're now

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.750
the manager of Taiyufeng.

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:26.830
You can afford to spend lavishly.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.720
I'll give you wealth and honor.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.160
Do you want it?

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.400
You know where I came from.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:36.960
The people locked up there

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.160
are all men of wealth.

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:39.950
That taught me one thing:

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.400
in this world,

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:43.310
nothing matters

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:44.680
more than staying safe.

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:58.200
In 10 days,

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.830
representatives of the Eight Families
will gather at Jinyang Villa.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.160
Among these Eight Families

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.830
is the Kang family.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.110
They lost His Highness's
military supplies.

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:11.190
The imperial court is furious.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.860
This time they will definitely
punish them.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:15.510
The Kang family

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:17.680
has been in bodyguard business
for generations

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.310
and is very wealthy,

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.110
but now

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.480
they have no choice
but to sell off their property.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.440
Do you think they're selling property?

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.040
What they're selling is their family name.

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:33.880
I understand what you mean.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.480
You want to go all in—

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.290
buy out the Kang family,

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.700
enter the Eight Families,

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:43.160
and get your share

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:44.530
of King Li's Treasure.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.320
But even if you know

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:51.960
where the treasure is,

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:54.040
what could you possibly do?

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:55.440
After all, that treasure

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.970
is jointly controlled
by the Eight Families.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.790
People say you're a nerd,

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:06.780
and you really are.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.180
What is money?

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.610
A small amount of money
can reach the gods,

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.030
and a vast amount

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:16.710
is the god itself!

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:29.310
Ms. Yu'er.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:34.880
Where are you going?

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:35.880
Don't touch me.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:42.920
It's getting cold.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.450
Put it on.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:50.880
Did my clothing offend you?

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:53.960
You look quite pleased with yourself.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.560
I haven't seen you in so long.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:58.400
Mr. Chang is in jail.

00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:59.350
I'm worried too.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.160
But what good would it do
for me to go back?

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.020
Should I cry with you face to face?

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:07.310
But you still didn't come,

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.610
leaving me there guessing alone.

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:10.590
Heizi—

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.450
you know him.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.410
He never thinks before he speaks.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.900
You look drunk,

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.590
not at all like someone about to cry.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:20.830
What?

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:21.960
In your eyes,

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.240
am I someone who only cares about wealth?

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.640
You think I want to be in a foreign place?

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.590
You think I want to be this

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:28.720
puppet manager?

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:31.480
How is Pingyao a foreign place?

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.960
I was born here.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.350
I...

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:37.000
I mean...

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.920
my home is in Huizhou,

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.180
and now I can't go back.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.930
So I can't fulfill my filial duty
to my mother.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.830
So for me, Pingyao

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.200
is indeed a foreign place.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.180
You're always so clever with words.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.180
Anyway, nothing I say seems right.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.030
You're driving me crazy.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:05.550
My father is sick,

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.270
sometimes better, sometimes worse.

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:09.250
He lives there without sunlight.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:11.920
Though he's treated
better than other convicts,

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.270
it's still a prison.

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:14.740
I told him to rest well,

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.470
yet he asks about you every day.

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:17.960
How am I supposed to answer that?

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.820
Tell him you're a big manager now,

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:21.400
dressing all fancy every day

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.150
and wearing a big black cloak?

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.640
Just tell Mr. Chang that.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.640
See if he believes it.

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.320
As for you,

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.480
don't keep listening to all that gossip.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.920
It's all just for show.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.270
Only a fool would believe it.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.070
I'm not a fool.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:37.940
Although I said that to you,

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.400
I don't really believe it.

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:40.960
I told Heizi

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.750
that if you were a person chasing wealth,

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.680
you would have stayed on the grasslands.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.270
I...

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:50.270
I'm just anxious.

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:53.160
Alright.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:55.080
Stop talking nonsense.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.770
Didn't I tell you last time?

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:57.550
Wang Tiangui asked me

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.030
to complete two tasks for him.

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:01.760
Only when they're done
will he release Mr. Chang.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.920
Someone's upstairs.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.590
You keep saying the same thing
over and over.

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:12.060
Get lost, Gu!

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:13.240
What?

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.590
It's so cold today.

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:18.310
Keep it for yourself

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:19.770
so you can live a long life!

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.820
You ungrateful thing!

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:23.790
Get lost!

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:18.030
This was given to me by a Russian.

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.960
This...

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:28.070
This... this...

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:29.310
What's with all this stammering?

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:31.200
You, a young master, have no clue

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:32.590
about doing a thief's job.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:34.790
Someone's been sitting here for ages,

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.410
and you didn't even notice.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:38.540
I wasn't born to be a thief.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.030
I'm just curious.

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:42.350
Curious?

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.890
What do you want to know?

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.160
Was it you who sent those dozens of people

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.240
over there?

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:55.890
To the south of the Yangtze River?

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.590
You really are a rebel?

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.290
Didn't you already know that? Why ask?

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:04.280
And my father still listens to you?

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.480
Doesn't he know that dealing with

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:05.920
someone like you

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.680
could get our whole family executed?

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.830
Well said.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.880
You truly are a filial son.

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:15.270
Shouldn't you ask your father

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:16.880
why he listens to me?

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:18.750
Why are you here interrogating me?

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:19.350
Yes.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:20.880
Of course I'll ask him.

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:22.730
But I want to ask you first.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.160
You must know the reason.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.240
Of course I do.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.400
But your father

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.660
told me not to tell you.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:31.640
He said you're just a child.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:44.280
You want to know

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:45.970
why I came to Pingyao with you?

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.400
Now you know.

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:50.350
I have my own business.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.650
You should

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.640
just do your job as the young master.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:54.680
Don't cause trouble.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.540
Before we left, I told your father

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.610
it didn't matter
whether you could make a profit or not.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:02.200
If you lose, just see it as a joke.

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:04.690
The bigger the joke,

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:06.790
the better it works as a cover for me.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:08.630
No wonder.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:09.830
Of course.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.790
If it weren't for you
stirring things up here

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:13.790
and drawing everyone's attention,

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:15.160
gathering all those people

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.090
would have made me too suspicious.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:17.960
Come to think of it,

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.690
you made a great contribution.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.240
If we get a chance to go to the south,

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.370
I'll make sure to reward you properly.

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:25.400
You've finished your business.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.310
Now leave.

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:28.590
My father is extremely wealthy.

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:30.160
Even if he owed you any favors,

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.640
they should be repaid by now.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.240
Go.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.310
You're quite amusing, kid.

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:39.360
There's no way
I'd ever let your father go—

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.400
and now I won't let you go either.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.310
You really think
I wouldn't dare pull the trigger?

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:05.680
If you're going to do it,

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:07.880
at least choose something that works.

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:10.150
This is a gift from my friend.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.570
It's never been loaded.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.160
Every time I play with it,

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.750
I polish it carefully for hours.

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:15.480
Put it away.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.530
You're holding it so carelessly.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.770
Aren't you afraid it'll hurt my heart?

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:21.530
Put it back.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.460
You just won't listen.

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:35.350
Seriously.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:38.040
You've gotten it all dirty.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:44.090
There's no bullets in it.
Who are you trying to scare?

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:57.720
Next time you enter my room,

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.380
I'll put a bullet in your head.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.400
Get out.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.480
Stop.

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:14.790
Tomorrow, bring more men

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:15.830
and get the carriages and horses ready.

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:17.490
We're going to Jinyang Villa.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.400
The Kang family
of the Eight Families of Hedong

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.750
is selling their property.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:22.150
I'm determined to get it.

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:25.100
And tell your friend

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.830
that if he doesn't want to be
sent back to Ningguta,

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:28.890
he'd better not cause trouble for me.

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:44.950
[Jinyang Villa]

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.200
Excuse me, are First Master Jin
and First Madam Jin

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:57.790
at home?

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.200
I'm the manager of Taiyufeng.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.310
My name is Gu Pingyuan.

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.460
This is my calling card.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.870
[The Eight Families of Hedong,
First Madam Jin]

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.260
The manager of Taiyufeng is so young.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.720
That old dog Wang Tiangui

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.880
must be blind.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.680
Could you please deliver my card?

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:18.200
I am First Madam Jin.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:20.340
Come in.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.550
I've heard so much about you.

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:23.950
It's an honor seeing you.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:37.590
Manager Gu,

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.060
please have a seat.

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:41.160
I'll attend to my husband
while he takes his medicine

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.960
and then come back to talk to you.

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:14.080
So you like stones too, Manager Gu?

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:18.190
They have a certain rustic charm.

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.670
Do you know

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:20.270
the history of these stones?

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.139
They're Taihu stones,

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.100
transported from Taihu Lake.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.600
Partly right,

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:28.110
and partly wrong.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.480
These

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:31.480
were the stones personally chosen
by Emperor Huizong

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.139
of the Northern Song Dynasty.

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:34.480
He gathered rare stones
from all over the land

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.880
to be shipped back to Bianjing.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:36.760
But before the boats arrived,

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.760
the dynasty fell.

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:38.920
The boatmen, to save their lives,

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.630
dumped all these stones

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:40.670
into the Yangtze River.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:43.600
And the river
washed over them for hundreds of years.

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:45.790
My husband loves stones too.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.820
He spent five years

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.460
having all of them salvaged.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:52.560
Truly a man of great wealth.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.730
These are national treasures.

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:56.350
National treasures?

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.530
If you ask me,

00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:58.760
they're nothing but things

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.560
that ruin families and nations.

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.210
In famine years,

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.020
they're not even worth a steamed bun.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.400
Madam,

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.530
that's a very insightful view.

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:11.610
Save the flattery.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.600
My husband is in poor health.

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:15.930
Didn't you just see it?

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.480
Yes.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.070
I didn't expect he's...

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.250
I came at an unfortunate time.

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:24.920
He's been like this since he was young.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.110
He's simply too clever,

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:27.320
too skilled in business,

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.440
and he stole heaven's secrets.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.770
At his age, he's already

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.670
like a candle flickering in the wind,

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:32.960
a lamp caught in the rain.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:33.880
He has no son,

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:36.250
and his siblings are a complete mess.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.210
Everything falls on me alone. Sit.

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:42.160
Please sit down.

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.680
Let's talk business.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.150
My boss sent me specifically

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.070
to pay respects to everyone
from the Eight Families.

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:52.280
He wishes to use his own funds

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.280
to buy all of the Kang family's property

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:55.070
and help them

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:56.970
survive their present hardship.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.080
What else?

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.360
Our boss also said that

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.480
the Eight Families of Hedong
have been prominent

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.070
in the Qing Empire's business world
for more than 200 years

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:11.280
and have been leaders among merchants
across the country.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.840
He holds your families
in great admiration.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.000
If he can take this opportunity

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.460
to buy out the Kang family,

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:17.240
would you be willing to help him

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:19.360
gain a place among the Eight Families?

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.760
It would also be a way

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.540
to contribute to the country.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.400
Wang Tiangui

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.040
would never say such things.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.110
Mr. Gu, you're an educated man.

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:32.040
These are your words, aren't they?

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.190
Yes.

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:36.590
It's polite talk,

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.120
but it's also truly what I think.

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:43.360
The Eight Families?

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:46.350
What Eight Families?

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.120
We've long been scattered to the winds.

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:52.550
Master Sun
from Sun family in southern Shanxi

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:53.840
and the Li family in northern Shanxi—

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:54.800
they all have more influence

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.930
than our Jin family.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:57.400
But...

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:11.450
Meeting you today

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:12.910
is already a great honor.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:13.920
Since that's the case,

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.320
I won't trouble you further.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.580
I'll take my leave now.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.760
I, Gu Pingyuan, Manager of Taiyufeng,

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.990
am here to pay my respects to you, Mr. Li.

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.840
[The Eight Families of Hedong,
Li Zhongdeng]

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:36.300
Please.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.960
Fujian rock tea?

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.320
It really is the finest tea in the world.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.020
You know tea?

00:37:59.020 --> 00:37:59.280
[Beauty of Spring]

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.280
I'm from Huizhou.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:02.880
I grew up in tea fields.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.340
I've sampled a little with my family.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.460
Since you know tea, you're not a fool.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:09.280
Let me ask you.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.920
What makes you think

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.000
that Taiyufeng can enter the Eight Families
of Hedong

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.400
just by buying the Kang family's property?

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:17.880
Is Wang Tiangui alone

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.640
richer than all of us?

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:20.710
Of course not.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.670
The Eight Families of Hedong

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:24.730
have always looked after each other.

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.400
Why would we need outsiders
bringing in money?

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.530
Wang Tiangui thinks

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:30.330
he can compete with us,

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:30.950
doesn't he?

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:31.800
No, not at all.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.810
Let me ask you another question.

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:33.510
Mr. Li,

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:35.480
I've long admired your reputation.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.410
I came specially today to meet you.

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:39.230
You're the host and I'm the guest.

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:41.630
Would you allow me to say a few words as well?

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:45.530
Go ahead.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.630
As you said,

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:50.960
the Eight Families have always looked after each other.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:52.920
The other seven families are wealthy beyond measure.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.280
They could easily spare a fraction of their wealth

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.920
to cover the deficit the Kang family is facing.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:56.630
So why has the Kang family

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:58.490
been forced to sell its property?

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:01.070
But anyway,

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.550
Taiyufeng

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:04.770
is the wealthiest household in Pingyao.

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:06.230
Even if we join the Eight Families,

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:08.490
at least we wouldn't bring you any shame.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.680
Yet Madam Jin spoke vaguely,

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.710
and you turned me away

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:12.840
outright.

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:14.510
Has our boss

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:15.710
offended you somehow?

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:17.120
Or is there something else

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.440
behind all this?

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:26.830
That old guy Wang Tiangui...

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.370
I never admired him before.

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:29.790
But now I suppose...

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:31.840
I admire him a little.

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:35.200
How did he manage to get someone like you

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.230
working for him?

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:40.280
I am Li Zhongdeng.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.080
I'm paying my respects to you this time.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:44.840
Please.

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:47.070
This way.

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:51.090
Please come in.

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:05.960
Mr. Gu, come.

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:10.960
Ms. Su.

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.360
I should have come to pay my respects long ago.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.630
Today I finally meet you.

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.890
Why should you pay respects to me, Mr. Gu?

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:21.420
You stirred up

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.010
such a commotion in Shanxi.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.670
I'm truly impressed.

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:27.110
If it weren't

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:28.630
for your clever tricks

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:30.170
making the merchants of Pingyao

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:31.640
fall ill,

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:34.750
I wouldn't have had my hands free to do all this.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000
In a sense,

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:37.790
I ought to thank you.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.100
Have a seat.

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.730
Let's sit down and talk.

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:47.480
Wang Tiangui is determined to succeed this time.

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:48.610
If you want to buy it,

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.170
please give me a chance.

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:51.870
We're brothers.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.760
Of course I can give you a chance.

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:55.890
But she's the one who's buying it.

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.670
Kang,

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:04.640
explain to everyone

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.150
why you insisted on sending out notices

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:08.480
to wealthy merchants across the country

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.400
to buy your family's property.

[The Eight Families of Hedong, Kang Suyuan]

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.230
There are no outsiders here today.

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:14.510
Make it clear to us.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.730
If you can't explain yourself,

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.860
don't even think about leaving this room.

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:20.290
[The Eight Families of Hedong, Sun Yucheng]

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:26.480
Rumors have been spreading

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.190
that the Eight Families

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:29.050
are guarding King Li's Treasure,

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:30.030
and the stories

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:32.090
have grown more and more outrageous.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:32.880
The imperial court

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.230
is now watching us.

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:37.840
They can't raise funds for the war in the south.

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:39.320
This time our family was transporting

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.900
His Highness's military supplies,

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:41.800
and somehow

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.770
a big fire burned everything down.

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.570
Our opponent is clearly keeping an eye

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:47.630
on how much property our family owns.

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.360
If I quietly

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.430
use your money

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.660
to repay it,

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:53.920
the imperial court's suspicions

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.150
will be confirmed.

00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:57.760
Everyone,

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.160
if the Kang family doesn't go bankrupt now,

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.360
the Eight Families

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.730
will truly be finished.

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:06.730
The imperial court

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.560
will definitely strike us hard.

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:10.280
I might as well sell everything

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.440
and go home to look after my children and tend the land,

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:12.320
which would be much easier.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.380
Don't you think so?

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.550
That makes sense.

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:32.790
You've suffered a lot, Kang.

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.710
Here, get up first.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:37.590
Kang,

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:39.550
this isn't the right way.

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:41.340
Do you think that if you sacrifice your family to ease the trouble,

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:43.470
the imperial court won't suspect you?

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:44.590
Not necessarily.

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:45.550
Can't you see?

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.320
Everyone outside

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.510
is only after

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:49.910
King Li's Treasure.

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:52.760
Buying the Kang family's property is just an excuse.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.000
Their real goal is to get into the Eight Families

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.890
and find out

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.110
where the treasure is.

00:42:57.110 --> 00:42:58.240
Then let them buy it.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.150
Once they do,

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:02.000
they'll realize

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:03.250
it's not like it seems.
