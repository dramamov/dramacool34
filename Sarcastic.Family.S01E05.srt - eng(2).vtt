00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.280
I'm into emotional rock music.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.959
Depression.

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:55.120
So depressed.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.159
People like us,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.680
who do art,

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.840
are especially prone

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.879
to depression.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.200
Taking handfuls

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.040
of medication.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.719
Aren't you taking metformin?

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:05.799
Isn't that for diabetes?

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.480
Can you stop messing around?

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.800
The one who spoke just now

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.280
is our housekeeper.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.039
Right, where were we?

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.639
We were talking about your depression.

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.000
I just like melancholic men.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.680
They seem so deep.

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:19.479
Yeah.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:20.639
Just like

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.599
Freddie Mercury.

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:23.719
His song,

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.599
Colombian Rhapsody.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.879
The one he wrote,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.759
it's

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.360
Pakistani Rhapsody.

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.599
In-law.

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:36.520
Look at that British Shorthair,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.319
meowing, meowing, meowing.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.879
What's it called?

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.240
My thoughts are all interrupted.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.680
It's in heat, obviously.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.280
Always thinking about finding a mate.

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:43.360
So annoying.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.439
I'll get it fixed one day.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.840
Who are you talking about?

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.479
Whoever feels guilty, that's who.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.400
I'm saying, will you ever stop talking?

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.960
Is this your shop

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.319
or is it mine?

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.919
You just boss me around.

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.400
I hired you to help out,

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.360
not to argue with me.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.719
I...

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:01.960
Let me take a look.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.120
Revealed your true self, huh?

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:07.800
You're a cat spirit!

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.039
No, you're not any better.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.719
This is the real us.

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:15.120
Why did she hang up?

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:17.120
Hung up.

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.000
What are you doing?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.639
Can you please stop messing around?

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.280
Seriously.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.240
Online dating at your age?

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:24.919
That's embarrassing.

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:26.639
I'm embarrassed?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.400
I...

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.759
This...

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:29.599
She's a female friend I met on a music forum.

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:30.680
She can compose music.

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.639
I want her to write a song for our band.

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:33.199
Right?

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.080
And she doesn't charge.

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:35.400
So when necessary,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.120
of course I have to show my charm.

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:38.439
It's business.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:39.840
At your age,

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.319
what charm are you showing?

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:42.840
Show your medical records instead.

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.599
You...

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:44.039
You...

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.000
Don't look down on me.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.199
I'm telling you, I've never lied to her.

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.960
See?

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:48.039
I didn't lie to her.

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:50.080
How old are you?

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.639
Listen,

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.120
how old do I sound?

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.960
Did I lie to her?

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.680
I didn't, right?

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.599
Early thirties, maybe.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.360
You seem pretty mature.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.280
I didn't say anything.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.919
I just chuckled.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.680
Did I lie to her?

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.360
I've really learned something.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.479
Don't deny.

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:08.159
Don't admit.

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.879
Don't take responsibility.

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:10.719
That's typical human

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:12.479
scumbag behavior.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.160
She deleted me.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.720
You compensate me.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.959
Compensate you for what?

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.839
Go confess at the police station with you?

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:22.000
Fraudster.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.480
You, you apologize to her.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.399
Make her add me back.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.439
How big is your face?

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.879
Size forty-five?

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.439
Alright, alright.

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:34.160
Apologized.

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:36.360
I deleted her too.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.160
So you won't be upset.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.639
You...

00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:59.399
The diamond on this ring

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.800
is so big.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.160
It must be really expensive.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.519
Let me tell you,

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:06.560
in front of my boss,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.519
I endured hardship and waited.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.600
I swallowed my pride and carried the burden,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.560
all for this moment.

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.120
So I could give you the best.

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.839
Expensive.

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:15.079
How much more expensive could it be?

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:16.240
Look.

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:21.560
This one.

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:22.519
This one's nice.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.600
This one looks good too.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.839
Eighty-eight thousand.

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.839
This...

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.360
We still need to

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.800
compare with other stores.

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:32.319
Right?

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:37.040
You think it's too expensive.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.519
Mom,

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.759
this diamond ring

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.120
is just a formality.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.040
See?

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.639
Not answering my question directly.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.959
What's this?

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.000
Not admitting it.

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:49.120
Not denying it.

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:50.120
Not taking responsibility.

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.279
Scumbags all use the same tricks.

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:53.680
Wait...

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:55.360
How did I become a scumbag again?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.519
See?

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.639
Changing the subject, right?

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.879
Not talking about the ring anymore.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.000
I'm not the one changing the subject.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.399
Didn't you bring up scumbags?

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:06.319
Fine then.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.439
Let's

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.279
keep talking

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:11.319
about the diamond ring.

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:13.040
Are we buying it or not?

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:13.879
Buy.

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:15.439
We definitely have to buy it.

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:16.920
But...

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.839
Which one should we buy?

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:20.079
Can't just decide randomly.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.519
We need rational consumption.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.199
See?

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:25.199
You're still not answering me directly.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.879
I, uh...

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.399
Lili, help me out here.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.240
Don't bother with her.

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:33.879
That's just how she is.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.839
See?

00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:37.240
Lili didn't deny me directly either.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.040
Think about it yourself.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:06.839
Buy.

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:09.680
I didn't say I was buying.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.639
I'm just looking.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.519
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:12.279
Just looking.

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:13.959
Buy it and admire it at home.

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:17.079
Meng Hang,

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:18.519
even if we have money,

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.199
we still need rational consumption, right?

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.959
My idea of rationality

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.199
is just to consume.

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:03.279
Let's start the debate.

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:04.160
Cai Xiaoying,

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:04.720
go ahead.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.800
Wanting to buy a ring is a good attitude.

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:10.399
But...

00:08:10.519 --> 00:08:12.399
Attitude without action

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.079
is just

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.920
empty promises.

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:15.639
I didn't say I wouldn't buy.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.319
I'm just delaying the purchase.

00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:17.879
In the end,

00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:18.600
I still

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:19.680
will buy it.

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:21.439
Everyone, please note:

00:08:21.639 --> 00:08:22.560
My opponent

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.480
is confusing a concept.

00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:25.319
Buy

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:26.199
and will buy

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:27.399
one word apart,

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.720
worlds apart in meaning.

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:29.560
Buy

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.879
is present tense.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.839
Will buy

00:08:31.839 --> 00:08:33.039
uses present tense

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.360
to describe the future.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.879
What is the future?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:36.720
The future is

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.759
an uncertain time.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.159
If someone comes up to you now and says,

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.600
"I'll buy you a diamond ring in the future,"

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:44.559
what does that mean?

00:08:44.679 --> 00:08:45.039
It means

00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:47.200
he'll never buy you a diamond ring.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:48.600
I...

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.919
That's not what I meant.

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:51.080
I think...

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.200
I think

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:53.399
you should just

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.960
pay by card right now.

00:08:55.399 --> 00:08:56.240
But I...

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.200
But you don't want to buy it.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.759
Why don't you want to buy it?

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.240
Because you don't want to get married.

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:03.080
Why don't you want to get married?

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:04.960
Because you're afraid of commitment.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.159
Why are you afraid of commitment?

00:09:06.159 --> 00:09:07.879
Because you're irresponsible.

00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:09.279
Why are you irresponsible?

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.799
Because of paternal inheritance.

00:09:15.879 --> 00:09:16.440
Lili,

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:19.320
please help me out here.

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:36.879
What's going on with you two?

00:09:57.799 --> 00:09:58.399
Yuanyuan,

00:09:59.159 --> 00:10:00.399
what do you think of me

00:10:00.519 --> 00:10:01.159
as a person?

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:06.240
Then what do you think of Liao Kai?

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:07.480
What's it to you?

00:10:14.159 --> 00:10:14.799
Little Meng,

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.639
I seriously suspect

00:10:16.879 --> 00:10:18.279
Yuanyuan and Liao Kai

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.240
have something going on.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.879
How come you're not interested

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.159
in such serious gossip?

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:28.679
Meng,

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:30.440
why do I feel

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.440
you've been down lately?

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.559
What's wrong?

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:40.120
Don't even mention it.

00:10:41.639 --> 00:10:43.320
My mother-in-law moved in with us.

00:10:43.879 --> 00:10:44.360
And

00:10:45.799 --> 00:10:46.960
she's got a sharp tongue.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.080
A real viper.

00:10:48.799 --> 00:10:50.320
Then get her a snake-taming hat.

00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:53.000
Even Master Fahai couldn't help.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:53.840
Darn it.

00:10:54.639 --> 00:10:55.879
Her words are vicious.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.279
She roasts me every day.

00:10:57.639 --> 00:10:58.679
My wife doesn't back me up.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.159
And my dad's no help either.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.919
I feel like I'm getting depression.

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:09.519
That's no small problem.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.399
Lately,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.679
have you lost interest

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.799
in everything?

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:16.840
Kind of.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.039
Do you feel life is meaningless?

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.480
Honestly, yes.

00:11:23.159 --> 00:11:23.799
Even

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.759
the two hundred I owe you,

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:26.600
you don't even want it back.

00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:27.360
Not true.

00:11:27.919 --> 00:11:28.799
Money's different.

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:30.320
This is a mental issue.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.879
It's serious.

00:11:32.039 --> 00:11:32.559
About the money,

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:34.279
you have to do as I say.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.480
Mental health

00:11:35.559 --> 00:11:36.639
is a big deal.

00:11:36.919 --> 00:11:37.480
With you like this,

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.519
I

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.639
know a psychologist.

00:11:39.879 --> 00:11:41.320
I'll send you the address now.

00:11:41.879 --> 00:11:43.080
You know a psychologist?

00:11:43.799 --> 00:11:44.360
Mention me,

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.480
you'll save two hundred.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.240
Really?

00:11:47.159 --> 00:11:47.600
Thanks.

00:11:49.159 --> 00:11:49.679
You're a real bro.

00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:51.960
Alright.

00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:53.360
So,

00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:55.000
Saving that two hundred counts as me paying you back.

00:12:01.559 --> 00:12:04.639
Darkness.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:12.320
Endless darkness.

00:12:15.799 --> 00:12:17.120
Might summon the wolves.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.720
Others' voices are kissed by angels,

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.480
yours is chewed by a husky.

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:27.200
Shishi.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.440
That's the vibe, more or less.

00:12:29.679 --> 00:12:31.080
Not sure if it's right, you decide.

00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:32.519
The next lyrics,

00:12:32.679 --> 00:12:33.960
help me write and arrange them.

00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:37.159
I want to fight the world's darkness too,

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.600
but all I get is

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.519
sleepless nights,

00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:42.440
hard to swallow.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.559
No idea who ate those three buns at lunch.

00:12:47.759 --> 00:12:48.639
Shishi.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.960
Wait for me a sec.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.159
Let me battle this endless darkness.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.840
What are you doing? What are you doing?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.639
Can you not butt in?

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.320
I don't need a sidekick when talking to a lady.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.159
You chat one away, then another.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.200
You never leave empty-handed.

00:13:08.039 --> 00:13:08.879
Bet you didn't expect that.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.080
That's the one from before.

00:13:11.159 --> 00:13:12.799
She deleted me by accident before.

00:13:12.799 --> 00:13:14.000
Now she added me back.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:14.919
She said,

00:13:15.159 --> 00:13:17.200
pretty faces are all the same,

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.639
depressed souls are one in a million.

00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:20.279
Let me tell you,

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.120
she and I

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.559
really click.

00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:23.639
Click?

00:13:23.879 --> 00:13:26.080
Your head's so square, it's like a mahjong tile.

00:13:26.159 --> 00:13:27.320
Where's the roundness?

00:13:28.279 --> 00:13:29.960
I'm begging you,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.240
when I'm talking to her,

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.480
please don't interrupt, okay?

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.240
She's calling again.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.840
It's a video call.

00:13:39.039 --> 00:13:40.799
That's my charm.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.039
Shishi.

00:13:52.679 --> 00:13:53.559
Shishi.

00:14:09.639 --> 00:14:10.279
Dr. Zhang,

00:14:11.879 --> 00:14:12.440
um,

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.480
this is my first time in therapy.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.279
In movies,

00:14:16.519 --> 00:14:17.720
people always lie down.

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:19.960
Why are you making me lie face down?

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.240
That's not the same.

00:14:22.759 --> 00:14:24.279
Lying down is therapy.

00:14:24.679 --> 00:14:26.679
Face down is my new invention.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.519
It's called essential oil—

00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:28.720
It's called, called, called—

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.840
Spiritual Massage.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.720
So before it was just therapy?

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.559
Before, just massage.

00:14:35.759 --> 00:14:36.720
Not as effective.

00:14:38.559 --> 00:14:39.200
Relax.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.159
My Spiritual Massage method

00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:43.639
is based entirely on psychology.

00:14:43.759 --> 00:14:44.399
Developed scientifically.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.679
Totally professional.

00:14:46.799 --> 00:14:47.279
Come.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.840
Let's check your questionnaire.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.120
One point.

00:14:58.679 --> 00:14:59.519
Zero.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.320
One.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.480
Final score:

00:15:07.679 --> 00:15:08.480
Seventeen.

00:15:08.679 --> 00:15:09.440
What's the total?

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.320
One hundred fifty.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.559
Is it that bad?

00:15:15.879 --> 00:15:16.559
Nurse Zhang,

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.399
admit the patient right away.

00:15:19.799 --> 00:15:21.440
And bring a sedative.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.519
Patient's condition is dire.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.720
Violence could break out anytime.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.080
Dr. Zhang,

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.720
I can hear you.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.000
Don't mind.

00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:34.039
Just in case.

00:15:34.879 --> 00:15:35.399
Wait,

00:15:35.759 --> 00:15:37.840
is my mental illness that bad?

00:15:38.039 --> 00:15:39.240
I feel like my mood

00:15:39.679 --> 00:15:41.440
is pretty stable.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.200
Your current stability

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.000
is all built on

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.960
repressing lots of negative emotions.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.639
If you can't hold it in,

00:15:49.919 --> 00:15:51.320
you'll totally break down.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.039
Completely explode.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.600
Even risk schizophrenia.

00:15:54.879 --> 00:15:55.759
You must take medicine now.

00:15:56.279 --> 00:15:56.799
Luckily,

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.679
I've got a special medicine.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:15:59.960
One course

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:00.960
is fifty-eight hundred.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.519
All-natural, high-tech drug.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.960
Plant herbal essence.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.120
I'll go get it for you.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.919
You'll feel amazing after.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.879
You'll wish you were sick just to take it.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.519
One course costs five thousand eight hundred.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.080
How much do I have to spend on this?

00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:34.320
Masked Psychological Support Group

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.200
Isn't there a free program here?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.440
Still trying to scam me out of money.

00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:47.480
Come on, alpaca, have some food.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.840
Once upon a time

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.440
Not eating?

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:54.879
Someone loved you for a long time.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.759
And then

00:16:57.039 --> 00:16:58.240
Later on

00:16:58.679 --> 00:17:02.559
They stopped thinking of you.

00:17:02.559 --> 00:17:03.960
Stop singing.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.799
Even the alpaca isn't eating now.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.000
You're way too into the role.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.079
You're just reinforcing your tragic

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.200
persona, aren't you?

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.359
I just got back from the police station today.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.400
I told you,

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.039
this was bound to happen sooner or later.

00:17:19.799 --> 00:17:20.839
Shishi reported it, right?

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.319
I was the one who reported it.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.200
I got scammed.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.480
The police called me and said

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.640
Shishi was caught.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.640
A guy over one meter eighty tall.

00:17:31.799 --> 00:17:33.480
I said every time we video chatted,

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.440
he always used that lion filter.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.160
Turns out he has a full beard.

00:17:41.599 --> 00:17:42.359
How much did he scam you for?

00:17:43.279 --> 00:17:43.920
Three thousand.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.200
His accomplices already moved it overseas.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.720
It can't be recovered anytime soon.

00:17:50.279 --> 00:17:51.160
In the hallway

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.039
Anti-fraud ads are on TV every day.

00:17:54.599 --> 00:17:55.359
Right in front of me,

00:17:55.519 --> 00:17:58.119
is a living, breathing sucker.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.519
Turtle, time to eat.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.319
Turtle.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.279
Turtle, time to eat.

00:18:14.119 --> 00:18:15.559
Stop overthinking.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.079
Go clean up the poop.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.559
It's piling up over there.

00:18:29.799 --> 00:18:30.680
Eat up.

00:18:51.359 --> 00:18:52.519
You're not actually depressed, are you?

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:55.119
Don't take it too hard.

00:18:55.519 --> 00:18:56.640
Love, you know,

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.640
is like a ghost.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.079
Many believe in it,

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.079
few ever meet it.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.480
It's not about love for me.

00:19:03.759 --> 00:19:05.160
I'm just upset about the money.

00:19:05.839 --> 00:19:06.640
That hurts.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.160
I'm not good at comforting people.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:10.400
It's just

00:19:10.599 --> 00:19:11.400
as the saying goes,

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.799
men sing when they're troubled,

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.079
women cry when they're troubled.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.359
Why not sing a bit more?

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.519
I promise I won't laugh at you.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.599
Not singing anymore.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:21.680
Oh no.

00:19:22.599 --> 00:19:23.759
It's about to flip belly up.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.799
I've sent you the photos.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.240
Check them yourselves.

00:19:30.519 --> 00:19:32.279
This crappy mask is way too small.

00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:34.279
Sorry, sir.

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:35.400
Ours is made for

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.039
children aged two to three.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.279
This size is just right.

00:19:39.759 --> 00:19:41.319
But you didn't mention that.

00:19:42.079 --> 00:19:42.759
Sorry about that.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.960
How about we send you another one?

00:19:45.039 --> 00:19:46.519
No time, I need it today.

00:19:54.559 --> 00:19:55.039
Hello.

00:19:55.279 --> 00:19:56.039
Your Bear Milk Tea

00:19:59.319 --> 00:19:59.799
was delivered to the wrong place.

00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:00.359
It's for upstairs.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:01.240
Sorry.

00:20:01.359 --> 00:20:02.319
Sorry, I messed it up.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.160
Wait a second.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:15.319
Life is a journey like this,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.680
how much suffering until it's complete?

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:27.400
No idea if I'll ever bounce back.

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:30.000
We're all

00:20:30.279 --> 00:20:33.440
people who tough it out.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:43.960
I'm late.

00:20:46.039 --> 00:20:47.000
Come in, please come in.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.559
Alright.

00:20:50.359 --> 00:20:51.759
Remember to knock next time.

00:20:52.119 --> 00:20:53.640
You startled me coming in like that.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.440
Calm your breathing.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.319
Let's continue sharing anonymously.

00:20:58.279 --> 00:20:59.240
This friend just now

00:20:59.519 --> 00:21:01.720
shared their relationship troubles.

00:21:02.279 --> 00:21:03.160
Now let's hear

00:21:03.319 --> 00:21:04.359
from our next friend.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.359
They'll share

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.279
what life issues they're facing.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.200
Why don't you go ahead?

00:21:13.319 --> 00:21:13.880
It's my turn.

00:21:15.839 --> 00:21:17.200
What's bothering me?

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.160
To be honest,

00:21:19.799 --> 00:21:21.480
I also opened a counseling office.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.720
We're in the same business.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:24.920
But for me,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.160
it's just being thrown into it.

00:21:27.279 --> 00:21:28.599
I used to run a restaurant.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:29.720
Did massages too.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.359
But every business failed.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.720
Now this one,

00:21:33.079 --> 00:21:34.680
isn't counseling popular?

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.200
So I thought I'd try it.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.200
This thing

00:21:37.319 --> 00:21:38.119
isn't that hard.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.039
It's just chatting.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.759
But after a few sessions, I felt

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.839
this chat is not that chat.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.359
The people I talked to

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.880
either wanted to jump in a river or hang themselves.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:45.920
I thought, this can't go on.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.240
So I came here to fix things before it's too late.

00:21:48.559 --> 00:21:49.920
Learn some psychology.

00:21:50.319 --> 00:21:51.720
Otherwise, every time I face my clients,

00:21:51.759 --> 00:21:52.920
I feel a lot of pressure.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.359
Feel like a fraud.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:56.920
No need to feel that way.

00:21:59.119 --> 00:22:00.440
We're just sharing stories.

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:02.599
No judgment on anything.

00:22:04.519 --> 00:22:05.119
Dr. Zhang

00:22:05.119 --> 00:22:05.720
Who wants to share?

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.319
Dr. Zhang

00:22:07.359 --> 00:22:07.720
Me.

00:22:07.839 --> 00:22:08.480
Meng Hang

00:22:08.759 --> 00:22:09.319
Meng Hang

00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:10.920
Why are you here?

00:22:11.759 --> 00:22:13.160
I saw in your office

00:22:13.519 --> 00:22:14.839
a poster for this place.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:15.920
You organized this?

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.599
I came here on my own.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.759
Why did you come?

00:22:20.279 --> 00:22:21.079
Give me back my consultation fee.

00:22:21.119 --> 00:22:22.400
You never paid me.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:28.680
Me

00:22:28.799 --> 00:22:29.400
Little Fish Head

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.599
Why don't you share something?

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.440
As for me,

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.359
there's someone—

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.000
a childhood friend I was really close to.

00:22:35.319 --> 00:22:36.519
We had a great bond.

00:22:36.839 --> 00:22:38.319
But what he doesn't know is,

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.559
when we were ten,

00:22:39.599 --> 00:22:40.480
while he was in the outhouse,

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.720
I set off firecrackers in the latrine.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.200
The one who ruined his appetite for life—

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.160
was me.

00:22:46.519 --> 00:22:47.480
That scene back then—

00:22:47.759 --> 00:22:48.480
just thinking about it...

00:22:50.079 --> 00:22:51.599
Anyway, it's been years since it happened.

00:22:51.839 --> 00:22:53.160
Every time I see him,

00:22:53.319 --> 00:22:54.079
I still

00:22:55.319 --> 00:22:55.960
feel uneasy inside.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:56.960
Me...

00:22:57.319 --> 00:22:59.519
Actually, I have a childhood sweetheart.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.359
We spent our days together,

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.000
peeing and playing in the mud for almost twenty years.

00:23:04.519 --> 00:23:04.880
And then,

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.160
we still mess around like that.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.759
And, and then...

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:09.920
After we grew up,

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.559
I kind of started liking him.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.480
But I, I...

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.519
I was too shy to say it.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.519
So later on,

00:23:15.759 --> 00:23:17.519
I became his male bestie.

00:23:17.799 --> 00:23:20.200
My family pressured me back then.

00:23:20.359 --> 00:23:21.920
So I picked someone from the blind dates

00:23:22.079 --> 00:23:23.920
who seemed decent and got married.

00:23:24.039 --> 00:23:26.000
But we have nothing in common.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.680
It's been two years since we married.

00:23:27.799 --> 00:23:29.039
Still feels like we're strangers.

00:23:29.319 --> 00:23:30.559
Every night I wake up

00:23:30.759 --> 00:23:31.720
and get startled.

00:23:32.079 --> 00:23:32.920
I lie there thinking for ages—

00:23:33.079 --> 00:23:34.920
who's this lying next to me?

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.240
Me

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.599
My mother-in-law has been staying
at our place lately.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.240
She criticizes me every single day.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.039
Sometimes I wonder if she's
an alien.

00:23:47.599 --> 00:23:48.960
Didn't notice.

00:23:49.119 --> 00:23:50.839
Humans with such low emotional
intelligence...

00:23:51.519 --> 00:23:52.599
My family is even less reliable.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:53.559
My dad

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.559
is lazy all day long.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.039
Whenever my mother-in-law says
men are unreliable,

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:57.839
my dad

00:23:57.839 --> 00:23:59.839
always shows up as a living example.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.480
My wife is the same.

00:24:01.759 --> 00:24:02.519
When her mom arrives,

00:24:02.519 --> 00:24:04.279
she instantly backs down.

00:24:04.559 --> 00:24:06.200
I thought she was tough.

00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:07.519
I don't dare confront her.

00:24:07.799 --> 00:24:08.480
Can't go against her.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.400
You say one thing,

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.559
she's got a hundred replies
ready for you.

00:24:11.319 --> 00:24:12.200
I keep thinking,

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.359
someone with such a sharp tongue

00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:16.319
must have a wicked heart.

00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:19.279
It's only because I'm wearing
a mask today

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.400
otherwise, this stuff

00:24:20.759 --> 00:24:21.720
I wouldn't dare say.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.759
I can tell

00:24:23.759 --> 00:24:25.319
you've been through a lot.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.720
This little zombie hasn't spoken
at all.

00:24:30.039 --> 00:24:31.039
Why don't you share

00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:32.720
the troubles you're facing?

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.559
I didn't have any problems
at first.

00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:37.000
But after coming here,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.559
I found a lot of issues.

00:24:39.519 --> 00:24:40.440
How should I put this...

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.839
I just don't get it.

00:24:44.359 --> 00:24:44.839
You

00:24:45.279 --> 00:24:46.720
Psychological counseling is popular,

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.880
so you pretend to be a counselor.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.799
The news says

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.039
the zoo is short on monkeys.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.880
Why don't you pretend to be
a monkey?

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.640
If you have time to fake it,

00:24:55.799 --> 00:24:57.240
why not think seriously

00:24:57.319 --> 00:24:58.799
about what you could actually do?

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.039
You

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.720
A simple apology could've solved it,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.519
but you held it in for years.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.480
That crap

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.160
was cleaned up long ago.

00:25:07.359 --> 00:25:08.440
But in your mind,

00:25:08.599 --> 00:25:09.640
it stays forever.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:11.880
And you,

00:25:12.839 --> 00:25:13.880
pretending to be a male bestie?

00:25:14.119 --> 00:25:14.960
When they get married,

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.039
you act as the bridesmaid.

00:25:16.279 --> 00:25:16.960
When they have a kid,

00:25:17.319 --> 00:25:18.039
you pretend to be the godmother.

00:25:18.519 --> 00:25:20.400
When they're a hundred and in ICU,

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.440
you'll pretend to be a patient.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.079
How long will you keep pretending?

00:25:23.359 --> 00:25:24.160
If you like him,

00:25:24.279 --> 00:25:25.960
just tell him.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:29.440
You

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:30.960
Your peers get married,

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:31.680
so you get married too?

00:25:31.799 --> 00:25:32.559
If your peers die,

00:25:32.559 --> 00:25:33.759
will you jump into the furnace too?

00:25:34.119 --> 00:25:34.799
As a couple,

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.079
is there anything you can't

00:25:36.079 --> 00:25:36.640
bring up

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:37.960
and talk openly about?

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.200
If you can stay together, do it.

00:25:39.359 --> 00:25:40.480
If not, just divorce.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.240
Why are you sharing here anyway?

00:25:44.839 --> 00:25:45.519
And you,

00:25:46.519 --> 00:25:49.400
your mother-in-law lives in the house
you and your dad own.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.440
Why don't you dare speak up?

00:25:52.759 --> 00:25:54.160
You're such a coward.

00:25:54.279 --> 00:25:54.920
You might as well

00:25:55.119 --> 00:25:56.480
put your mother-in-law's name

00:25:56.599 --> 00:25:58.039
on the first page of your family register.

00:25:58.799 --> 00:25:59.359
And you,

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.079
I don't even bother talking about you.

00:26:01.359 --> 00:26:02.000
Online dating,

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:02.960
add a filter,

00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:04.440
meant to scam others,

00:26:04.599 --> 00:26:05.799
but got scammed instead.

00:26:06.119 --> 00:26:07.640
Serves you right.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.279
Don't get it.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.079
Humans...

00:26:13.359 --> 00:26:15.559
With a mask on, you dare say anything.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.119
But usually,

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.559
it's like wearing a mask.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:20.880
I suggest

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.279
we take off our masks.

00:26:22.759 --> 00:26:23.759
That way,

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.440
we can be honest with each other.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.400
Okay.

00:26:29.359 --> 00:26:31.039
This friend made a great point.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.559
Since that's the case,

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.279
let's all follow her lead.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.039
Take off

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:35.680
the masks.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:36.839
Let's be open with each other.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:37.319
How about it?

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:37.759
Take it off.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:38.920
It's off.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:41.640
Take it off.

00:26:42.039 --> 00:26:42.519
Take it off.

00:26:58.839 --> 00:27:00.200
Why are they here?

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.880
If you're so free,

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.799
why not help me mop the pet shop?

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.519
You're so focused on a silly ad.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:27.519
Mom

00:27:28.039 --> 00:27:29.359
This ad is pretty interesting.

00:27:29.359 --> 00:27:29.759
Look,

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.480
Psychological Support Group.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.359
Do we have mental illnesses
on our planet?

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.519
Never heard of it.

00:27:36.039 --> 00:27:36.519
We do.

00:27:36.839 --> 00:27:38.119
But we cure them quickly.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.400
Old Man Meng

00:27:39.519 --> 00:27:40.400
said he had depression.

00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:42.200
He stopped working every day.

00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:43.680
On our home planet,

00:27:43.759 --> 00:27:44.799
he'd be cured in one day.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.200
How do you treat it?

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.039
The head

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.079
is sawed open.

00:27:51.839 --> 00:27:53.000
Take out the brain.

00:27:53.519 --> 00:27:54.240
Wash it.

00:27:55.119 --> 00:27:56.119
No blood streaks allowed.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.799
Wash it clean.

00:27:59.319 --> 00:28:01.920
Then sprinkle five mixed medicines.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.240
Let it sit for a while.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.079
Finally,

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:04.640
put it in

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.960
a high-temperature sterilizer.

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.440
Ding.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.720
Put it back in.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.880
Why is there something extra?

00:28:23.559 --> 00:28:24.039
I'm cured.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.759
Honestly, that sounds pretty good.

00:28:29.559 --> 00:28:30.319
But that thing of yours—

00:28:31.519 --> 00:28:32.519
What if it gets jammed?

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.519
No worries.

00:28:34.039 --> 00:28:35.599
Just put it in the regeneration chamber.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:36.920
Chop off the head.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:37.599
Then—

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.400
Grow a new one.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.079
That's way too violent.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:40.839
It's lucrative.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
The fees are sky-high.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:43.640
Mom.

00:28:43.799 --> 00:28:44.480
How about—

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.920
We join this support group.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.480
See how Earth people treat things.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.119
We can bring Dad along.

00:28:49.319 --> 00:28:50.359
He’s always so depressed.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.119
That’s not good.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.640
Sounds good.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.920
If he gets cured—

00:28:55.119 --> 00:28:56.039
He can work again.

00:29:06.799 --> 00:29:08.480
Looks like this friend lacks courage.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.119
Come on.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.599
Let’s all encourage him.

00:29:11.079 --> 00:29:12.039
Take it off.

00:29:12.359 --> 00:29:18.400
Take it off, take it off, take it off!

00:29:25.039 --> 00:29:25.559
Everyone—

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.200
See you next time.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.079
I’ve got something to do, I’ll head out.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.359
Meng Hang.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.599
Meng Hang, Meng Hang, answer the phone!

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.720
Is that you?

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.559
What a coincidence, everyone’s here.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:57.759
Yeah.

00:29:58.599 --> 00:29:59.480
The mean one—

00:29:59.759 --> 00:30:00.559
Is here too.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.440
That’s rough.

00:30:16.519 --> 00:30:18.359
Your whole family takes turns hitting you.

00:30:19.119 --> 00:30:21.240
I should help you heal your trauma.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.799
Just shut up.

00:30:24.079 --> 00:30:26.599
Stop talking about your therapy.

00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:29.400
Just use your skills—

00:30:29.759 --> 00:30:31.400
Fix my bones, that’s enough.

00:30:32.599 --> 00:30:33.319
Don’t worry, don’t worry.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.240
Bone setting, sure.

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:37.200
I’m a pro at bone setting and massage.

00:30:37.319 --> 00:30:37.799
Come on.

00:30:38.279 --> 00:30:39.039
Move over there a bit.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:41.799
Relax.

00:30:42.519 --> 00:30:43.119
Lift your face.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.119
Face, face, face.

00:30:45.759 --> 00:30:46.200
Relax.

00:30:46.559 --> 00:30:46.920
One.

00:30:47.319 --> 00:30:47.680
Two.

00:30:47.799 --> 00:30:48.200
Three.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:51.400
How’s that?

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.599
Is it fixed?

00:30:56.759 --> 00:30:57.319
Yeah.

00:30:58.279 --> 00:30:59.039
It doesn’t hurt now.

00:30:59.759 --> 00:31:01.000
But why do I feel—

00:31:01.839 --> 00:31:02.960
My right side—

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.440
Is numb.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.119
It’s fine.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.319
Totally normal.

00:31:19.839 --> 00:31:20.359
Totally normal.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:21.920
Let me get ready.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.039
I’ll do some acupuncture for you.

00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:24.839
Acupuncture works wonders.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:25.599
One poke—

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.559
You’ll feel it instantly.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:34.960
Doctor.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:36.920
Are you ready?

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.039
Doctor.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:44.640
Are you ready?

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:46.880
Doctor.

00:31:47.319 --> 00:31:48.799
Are you ready?

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.799
Doctor.

00:31:55.799 --> 00:31:59.039
Give back what you took from me.

00:31:59.039 --> 00:32:00.720
Come back, come back.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:01.599
Give it back.

00:32:01.759 --> 00:32:02.799
No more depression!

00:32:03.519 --> 00:32:05.359
The support group actually helps.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.119
It’s useless.

00:32:06.599 --> 00:32:08.519
Money cures heartache.

00:32:08.839 --> 00:32:09.400
My money—

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.680
Is about to be recovered.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.559
The police contacted you.

00:32:12.839 --> 00:32:13.839
They messaged me.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.440
Asked me to send them the account.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.960
I sent them the account and password.

00:32:27.359 --> 00:32:28.680
Got three thousand back.

00:32:29.599 --> 00:32:30.440
That’s great!

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.519
I knew you guys weren’t reliable.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.759
Look at their efficiency.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:35.799
Amazing.

00:32:37.119 --> 00:32:37.839
Thank you, thank you.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.160
Thank you, police.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.599
With that IQ—

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.079
Who else would scammers target?

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.359
You even pretended to be police and paid him.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.240
Totally unnecessary.

00:32:52.559 --> 00:32:53.920
Don’t let him hear that.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.000
I was worried his depression would get worse.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.400
This is great.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.000
Money solves everything.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:04.079
I’m feeling a bit down.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.680
Eat some oranges, you’ll feel better.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.160
My illness isn’t expensive.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.680
Two thousand is enough.

00:33:18.039 --> 00:33:19.240
From my observation—

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.880
Humans, when communicating—

00:33:21.039 --> 00:33:22.680
Always say one thing face-to-face—

00:33:22.759 --> 00:33:23.480
And another behind your back.

00:33:23.799 --> 00:33:24.720
They waste time—

00:33:24.799 --> 00:33:26.839
Guessing each other’s true intentions.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.799
It really lowers efficiency.

00:33:29.319 --> 00:33:31.079
If Earth people were like us—

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.079
And spoke directly—

00:33:32.279 --> 00:33:32.839
They’d definitely—

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.960
Be much better off.

00:33:34.279 --> 00:33:34.640
This—

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.759
Is a unique trait of our home planet.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.200
I’ll keep observing closely—

00:33:39.279 --> 00:33:41.359
The cultural differences between Earthlings and us.

00:33:41.559 --> 00:33:42.559
This comparative study—

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.839
For both civilizations—

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.759
Is highly valuable.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.359
Meng Hang.

00:33:51.759 --> 00:33:53.680
I finally finished this lousy shift.

00:33:53.799 --> 00:33:54.839
Let’s go see a movie tonight.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.480
It’s just a dumb report.

00:33:58.599 --> 00:33:59.599
Just bluff the boss.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:00.839
Throw in some big words.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:02.359
Alright.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.160
See you tonight.
