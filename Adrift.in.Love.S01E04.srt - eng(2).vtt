About the complex store concept I mentioned...

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:36.452
You've agreed to it, right?

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:40.456
I have some more ideas.
Do you want to hear them?

00:00:40.456 --> 00:00:42.458
You should play it safe first.

Once you've increased the number of customers
and foot traffic at the complex store,

00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:41.518
No, this is a busy month.
It'll be very busy if you take time off.

Can you make it clear?

00:03:40.555 --> 00:03:42.558
When we were together,
it was consensual.

I got beaten up by your mom for nothing.

00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:10.984

would've been a huge sum.

I just want my money back.

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:33.940
When you were with my husband,
you gave him money willingly.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.026
Now that you've broken up,
you want it back? Isn't that rude?

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:39.195
No wonder no one loves you. Let's go.

- Nothing. Find out what's going on first.

why not just say so?

00:05:41.882 --> 00:05:44.051
Are you happy now that
you see how miserable I am?

00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:45.970
100,000?

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.596
I thought it was a lot more.

00:05:47.596 --> 00:05:49.223
I'll transfer it to you now.

00:05:49.223 --> 00:05:50.474

Stop making excuses.
What's your account number?

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:57.773
No, I have no reason to take your money.

00:05:57.773 --> 00:05:59.817
I'm lending it to you, not giving it.

00:05:59.817 --> 00:06:01.695
You can pay me back when you have the money.

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:05.281
Or I can deduct it from your salary.

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:07.494
I don't borrow money from others.

00:06:10.428 --> 00:06:12.955
Why are you so troublesome?

00:06:12.955 --> 00:06:16.985
You were so fierce asking for money,
but now you don't want my help.

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:22.757
I don't need your help.
I'll figure something out myself.

Wait.

00:06:27.638 --> 00:06:30.473
How about I give you another part-time job?

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:32.458
But it's a bit difficult.

00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:35.087
I'll give you 100,000 if you complete it.

00:06:36.495 --> 00:06:39.481
What do you think? Want to earn some money?

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:42.193
I'm really sorry.

she apologizes to you in person.

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:50.076
It's okay.

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:53.079
We're both old,
but young people can't sit still.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:56.207
There will be a next time.

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:59.085

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:00.420

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.571
Okay, you're busy. Have a seat.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.476
I said no gifts, just your presence.

00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:18.104
It's not a big gift, just a token.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:20.381
Mr. Zhan, you're too kind.

00:07:20.381 --> 00:07:22.758
Director Qian, happy birthday.

00:07:24.026 --> 00:07:26.030

Really?

00:07:46.425 --> 00:07:49.120
Mr. Zhan, thank you for coming.

00:07:52.905 --> 00:07:54.807
Sorry we're late.

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:56.000
Mom.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.668
Happy birthday.

00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:02.064
Let me introduce everyone.

00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:05.054
This is my girlfriend, Pan Xin Tong.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.574
What a surprise.

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:15.981
I didn't expect Yi Fu's girlfriend
to be an employee of Hongfa.

00:08:16.804 --> 00:08:18.831
Your name is Pan Xin Tong, right?

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.082
Yes, Mr. Zhan.

00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:23.294
Chief Secretary Zhao speaks highly of you.

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:25.629
Yi Fu, you have good taste.

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:29.158
Yes, Mr. Zhan. Xin Tong is a good catch.

00:08:29.158 --> 00:08:31.410
It took me a long time to win her over.

00:08:32.304 --> 00:08:35.097
Pan Xin Tong, you're truly outstanding.

00:08:35.097 --> 00:08:37.057
A handsome man and a beautiful woman.

00:08:37.057 --> 00:08:39.268
You're a good match, aren't you, Xiao Qi?

00:08:39.268 --> 00:08:40.831
Being a match isn't the point.

00:08:40.831 --> 00:08:42.755
The point is liking each other.

00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:44.256
Hmm.

00:08:45.207 --> 00:08:46.984
Is that so?

00:08:46.984 --> 00:08:51.181
Then, Ms. Pan, what do you like about Yi Fu?

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:57.369
Mom, don't ask that question
in front of so many people.

00:08:57.369 --> 00:09:00.206
We're all family. What's wrong with that?

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:03.945
I think everyone would like to know.

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:10.051
I don't know either.

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:13.204
Maybe it's because
he likes spicy hotpot as much as I do.

00:09:13.204 --> 00:09:16.238
But he can't eat it alone.

00:09:16.238 --> 00:09:17.932
Maybe it's because he's just like me.

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:21.521
He goes crazy when he sees
fried dough fritters get mushy.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.165
Actually, I didn't like him at first.

00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:30.761
He acted like he was so handsome
that all girls would like him.

00:09:30.761 --> 00:09:33.347
It made me want to roll my eyes.

00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:39.143
But he always shows up when
I'm most vulnerable and need him the most.

00:09:39.922 --> 00:09:42.010
He appears unexpectedly.

00:09:45.876 --> 00:09:49.547
I was a bit scared when I started to like him.

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:53.514
Because I know we're different.

00:09:55.444 --> 00:09:57.846
But there are so many things that are the same.

00:09:57.846 --> 00:10:00.393
So, I wanted to be brave.

00:10:05.145 --> 00:10:08.316
Young people's love is that simple.

If there is any happy news,
remember to let us know.

00:10:14.863 --> 00:10:16.640
I don't know about that.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.518
It's still early.

00:10:19.218 --> 00:10:21.204
Come on, everyone.

00:11:28.562 --> 00:11:31.106
You didn't tell me you work at Hongfa either.

00:11:31.106 --> 00:11:34.735
Everyone here is my boss. I was so scared.

00:11:34.735 --> 00:11:36.862
If I had known, I wouldn't have agreed
even for a million dollars.

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:39.723
A million? Are you sure?

00:11:39.723 --> 00:11:42.060
Is that the point now?

00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:46.331
What else is the point?

00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:51.543
The point is, we've been walking for some time.

00:11:52.186 --> 00:11:53.921
Why are you still holding my hand?

00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:57.299
We agreed on three hours.
There are still three minutes left.

00:11:57.299 --> 00:11:59.677
But we don't have to put on an act anymore.

00:11:59.677 --> 00:12:00.939
My mom is scary.

00:12:00.939 --> 00:12:02.621
She'll send people to spy on us.

00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:04.584
It's better to be cautious.

00:12:06.517 --> 00:12:08.103
Don't look around.

00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:19.115
How long do we have to hold hands?

00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:23.871
We should at least cross the next intersection.

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:43.470
I'm off.

00:12:45.906 --> 00:12:47.766
Xiao Qi.

00:12:47.766 --> 00:12:51.228
Remember to take the supplements
I asked Pan Xin Tong to buy for you.

00:12:51.228 --> 00:12:53.105
It'll help you sleep better.

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:56.900
You have to take good care of yourself now.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.969
All right. Go home early.

00:12:58.969 --> 00:13:01.057
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:13:29.199 --> 00:13:31.351
Something 'bout love.

00:13:31.351 --> 00:13:34.313
Something 'bout dream.

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:38.025
Broken at a blast.

00:13:38.025 --> 00:13:40.360
Something good.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.654
Some mistakes.

00:13:42.654 --> 00:13:46.950
Blue will come through all at last.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.869
Try once again.

00:13:48.869 --> 00:13:51.288
Take one more chance.

00:13:51.288 --> 00:13:57.503
Make bad decisions in your fucking life.

00:13:57.503 --> 00:14:00.589
Fucking life.

00:14:00.589 --> 00:14:04.426
Mind the signs you'll find.

00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:07.679
Hey young boy tell me

00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:10.641
what's your trouble at the time.

00:14:10.641 --> 00:14:13.018
It's all right.

00:14:13.018 --> 00:14:15.062
Close your eyes.

00:14:15.062 --> 00:14:17.981
Let the flow rhyme, hang on tight.

00:14:17.981 --> 00:14:21.819
Don't be scared to fight.

00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:27.866
Hey, young boy, tell me
what you desire at the time.

00:14:27.866 --> 00:14:30.536
Just rhyme.

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:38.209
You'll be fine, you will thrive, be fine.

00:14:47.903 --> 00:14:50.222
Something good.

00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:52.432
Some mistakes.

00:14:52.432 --> 00:14:57.854
Blue will come through all at last.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.995
Happy birthday, Mom.

00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:15.500
Aren't you going to explain?

00:15:18.252 --> 00:15:20.711
Let's stop going in circles
with the same topic.

00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:23.213
You knew I invited Lin Feng Hua today.

00:15:23.213 --> 00:15:25.310
Why did you bring your girlfriend?

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:26.758
You're trying to embarrass me.

00:15:26.758 --> 00:15:28.302
Anyway, she's not here.

00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:30.483
Lin Feng Hua isn't interested in me,

00:15:30.483 --> 00:15:31.722
so let's not get ahead of ourselves.

00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:35.559
Thank goodness she didn't come,
or it would've been so awkward.

00:15:35.559 --> 00:15:38.020
But Director Lin knows
I'm trying to set you two up.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.897
It's still embarrassing.

00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:41.298
Isn't it for the best?

00:15:41.298 --> 00:15:43.468
Just give up on this idea.

00:15:46.528 --> 00:15:48.992
So, you really did it on purpose.

00:15:49.965 --> 00:15:52.409
Do you think if you embarrass me like this,

00:15:52.409 --> 00:15:55.832
I'll give up on the marriage alliance
with Director Lin's family?

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.250
You underestimate your mother.

00:16:01.059 --> 00:16:04.004
Why are you so stubborn?

00:16:04.004 --> 00:16:05.505
What do you want then?

00:16:05.505 --> 00:16:10.093
You've had so many girlfriends,
none of them lasted more than three months.

00:16:10.093 --> 00:16:14.056
Pan Xin Tong will eventually
become a thing of the past.

00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:16.927
When that time comes,
I'll wait for you two to break up,

00:16:16.927 --> 00:16:19.311
then I'll help you
and Lin Feng Hua get together.

00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:21.021
You already know my habits.

00:16:21.021 --> 00:16:24.566
Aren't you worried Lin Feng Hua and I
will get divorced after three months?

00:16:24.566 --> 00:16:27.761
In this day and age,
there's no such thing as a marriage alliance.

00:16:27.761 --> 00:16:30.724
I know exactly what's right for me.

00:16:31.465 --> 00:16:35.494
Mom, that's not going to work anymore.

00:16:44.505 --> 00:16:48.090
Then when will you
acknowledge your responsibility?

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.926
You promised your dad you'd take over.

00:16:50.926 --> 00:16:53.261
You said you wanted to expand the company.

00:16:53.261 --> 00:16:56.056
If you didn't rely on a marriage alliance,
could you have done it alone?

00:16:56.056 --> 00:16:58.809
So, you still don't believe in my abilities.

00:16:58.809 --> 00:17:01.436
My only value is to sacrifice my happiness.

00:17:01.436 --> 00:17:02.729
Is that what you think?

00:17:02.729 --> 00:17:04.022
Yi Fu, why do you have to...

00:17:04.022 --> 00:17:06.817
It's your birthday, Mom.
I don't want to argue with you.

00:17:09.086 --> 00:17:12.197
Why don't you make a wish
before your birthday ends?

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:14.950
Hope that you have an obedient son.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:18.895
Before that, I'll get to
know Pan Xin Tong better.

00:17:20.389 --> 00:17:25.488
By the way, maybe we'll prove you wrong
and last more than three months.

00:18:06.601 --> 00:18:08.128
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:18:08.128 --> 00:18:09.755
Where were we?

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:14.621
I want to tell you that
this painter's health has been...

00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:29.194
Xiao Qi.

00:18:33.726 --> 00:18:35.322
Get your hands off me!

00:18:35.322 --> 00:18:37.869
- Your pants.
- Wait, your key...

00:18:40.971 --> 00:18:43.330
- Wait.
- Bye.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.458
- Wait.
- Xiao Qi.

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:47.442
Slowly.

00:18:47.442 --> 00:18:48.860
Wait a minute.

00:19:12.275 --> 00:19:14.699
Your hands will be sore tomorrow.

00:19:16.696 --> 00:19:18.994
I'll go home and soak them in hot water.

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:26.205
Well...

00:19:27.541 --> 00:19:29.896
When should we meet tomorrow?

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.713
I'll let you know when I'm done.

00:19:33.713 --> 00:19:35.006
Okay.

00:19:41.995 --> 00:19:45.467
Then, good night.

00:19:46.368 --> 00:19:49.270
Good night.

00:19:57.779 --> 00:19:59.030
Hey.

00:20:06.746 --> 00:20:08.165
Good night.

00:21:15.373 --> 00:21:16.691
Yue Jiao.

00:21:16.691 --> 00:21:18.068
Yue Jiao.

00:21:21.237 --> 00:21:27.323
[Hou Ze: I never thought I'd say goodbye
to you in this manner.]

00:21:40.523 --> 00:21:41.800
Hey.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.551
What are you doing?

00:21:43.551 --> 00:21:46.638
I'm going to the hospital to see my mom.

00:21:46.638 --> 00:21:47.905
You're going to the hospital?

00:21:47.905 --> 00:21:49.683
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?

00:21:49.683 --> 00:21:51.685
What for?

00:21:51.685 --> 00:21:53.730
I have a car. I can give you a ride.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.322
You've met my mom.

00:21:55.322 --> 00:21:57.089
I want to meet yours, too.

00:21:58.608 --> 00:21:59.923
Hello?

00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:21.107
Handsome, do you have a cigarette?

00:22:25.844 --> 00:22:28.306
Handsome, do you have a cigarette?

00:22:29.725 --> 00:22:33.243
Handsome, do you have a cigarette?

00:22:33.243 --> 00:22:34.561
I don't smoke.

00:22:34.561 --> 00:22:39.357
Well, can you buy me a pack of these?

00:22:39.357 --> 00:22:42.152
Please, buy it for me.

00:22:42.152 --> 00:22:44.112
I can't. Please.

00:22:44.112 --> 00:22:45.698
My daughter is really pretty.
I'll introduce her to you.

00:22:45.698 --> 00:22:46.948
No, thanks.

00:22:46.948 --> 00:22:47.991
Why not?

00:22:47.991 --> 00:22:51.453
She's really great, so filial and pretty.

00:22:51.453 --> 00:22:52.537
Let me show you her photo.

00:22:52.537 --> 00:22:54.080
It's fine, don't bother.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.042
- Really?
- No need. I'll buy it for you.

00:22:57.042 --> 00:22:58.544
- This one?
- Yes.

00:22:58.544 --> 00:22:59.753
So handsome and kindhearted.

00:22:59.753 --> 00:23:01.548
Thought you'd make a good son-in-law.

00:23:01.548 --> 00:23:03.995
- Are you sure you don't want to look?
- It's really okay. Thank you.

00:23:04.653 --> 00:23:06.199
Thank you.

00:23:24.044 --> 00:23:26.529
You're a patient. Are you sure you can smoke?

00:23:26.529 --> 00:23:29.391
I'm going to die anyway.
It's better to smoke.

00:23:29.391 --> 00:23:32.018
I'd rather die a quick death than suffer.

00:23:33.161 --> 00:23:34.954
Why won't it light up?

00:23:34.954 --> 00:23:37.540
Why did you buy cigarettes without a lighter?

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.750
You gave me 100 yuan.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.502
- This pack of cigarettes is 140 yuan.
- It's not lighting up.

00:23:40.502 --> 00:23:42.363
Shi Mei Hua, what are you doing?

00:23:42.363 --> 00:23:44.031
Pan Xin Tong!

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:47.509
Why are you with my mom?

00:23:47.509 --> 00:23:48.676
She's your mom?

00:23:48.676 --> 00:23:50.804
You know each other?

00:23:50.804 --> 00:23:52.973
She's the girl I was going to introduce you to.

00:23:52.973 --> 00:23:54.641
Introduce what? Don't change the subject.

00:23:54.641 --> 00:23:56.209
Where did you get it?

00:23:56.209 --> 00:23:58.580
It has nothing to do with him.

00:23:59.371 --> 00:24:01.231
You gave my mom cigarettes!

00:24:01.231 --> 00:24:02.524
I bought them for her. I...

00:24:02.524 --> 00:24:04.401
You bought cigarettes for her?

00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:05.404
I have to explain this.

00:24:05.404 --> 00:24:09.283
My mom is sick. How could you let her smoke?

00:24:09.283 --> 00:24:11.158
This looks heavy. Let me carry it for you.

00:24:11.158 --> 00:24:13.269
Auntie, I'm here to pick you up.
Let me take you to the car.

00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:15.102
Let's go! Hurry!

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:31.292
[Zhou Xiao Qi: When will you be done?
Have time for dinner tonight?]

00:25:31.905 --> 00:25:33.576
Wow.

00:25:34.382 --> 00:25:36.184
Do you want something to drink?

00:25:36.184 --> 00:25:38.412
I'll get it for you. Give it to me.

00:25:38.412 --> 00:25:39.913
No, stop.

00:25:39.913 --> 00:25:42.464
Just go on. Don't mind me.

00:25:43.975 --> 00:25:46.419
It's so good to be home.

00:25:46.419 --> 00:25:48.254
I'm hungry.

00:25:48.254 --> 00:25:49.906
I'm so hungry.

00:25:49.906 --> 00:25:51.882
Okay, I'll go cook.

00:25:52.734 --> 00:25:54.511
- Um...
- Leave it here.

00:25:54.511 --> 00:25:56.721
I'll do it. You go on.

00:25:56.721 --> 00:25:59.682
- Just put it anywhere.
- Stay and eat with us later, okay?

00:25:59.682 --> 00:26:00.975
Okay.

00:26:01.701 --> 00:26:03.811
Of course, stay and eat.

00:26:03.811 --> 00:26:04.813
What about this?

00:26:04.813 --> 00:26:05.857
- Put it on the table.
- Okay.

00:26:05.857 --> 00:26:08.842
Sit down. Make yourself at home.

00:26:08.842 --> 00:26:10.134
Thank you.

00:26:13.213 --> 00:26:15.156
What's your name?

00:26:15.156 --> 00:26:17.497
- My name is Xin Yi Fu.
- Yi Fu.

00:26:17.497 --> 00:26:20.895
Yi as in perseverance, and Fu as in master.

00:26:20.895 --> 00:26:23.473
Yi Fu.

00:26:23.473 --> 00:26:27.009
Yi Fu, let me ask you something.

00:26:28.384 --> 00:26:31.513
What's your relationship with Xin Tong?

00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:34.926
We're friends.

00:26:34.926 --> 00:26:36.761
Friends, huh?

00:26:36.761 --> 00:26:40.473
Are you just ordinary friends,
or something more?

00:26:46.062 --> 00:26:49.458
An embarrassed grin? That's flirting.

00:26:50.166 --> 00:26:51.609
Flirting, huh?

00:26:51.609 --> 00:26:56.239
That's not good.
If you keep flirting, the love will fade.

00:26:56.239 --> 00:26:58.283
Mom, don't scare him.

00:26:58.283 --> 00:27:00.768
I'm not scaring him. It's true.

00:27:00.768 --> 00:27:03.548
Many people are after Xin Tong.

00:27:04.305 --> 00:27:05.790
She got scared and hid in there.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:07.250
The egg!

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.335
Be careful!

00:27:09.335 --> 00:27:13.279
I was just about to compliment you
on your cooking.

00:27:14.983 --> 00:27:18.177
- It smells so good.
- Food is served!

00:27:18.177 --> 00:27:19.596
Let's eat!

00:27:19.596 --> 00:27:23.474
This is the smell I missed most
when I was in the hospital.

00:27:23.474 --> 00:27:26.220
You can't get this anywhere else. Try it.

00:27:26.828 --> 00:27:29.480
I didn't know you were such a good cook.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.316
No, it's just home cooking.

00:27:31.316 --> 00:27:33.693
Are you kidding?

00:27:33.693 --> 00:27:35.069
When you two get married,

00:27:35.069 --> 00:27:37.405
you have to let her come back
and cook this for me sometime.

00:27:37.405 --> 00:27:40.700
Otherwise, I'll bother you every day.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.977
Aren't you hungry? Eat more.

00:27:42.977 --> 00:27:46.531
- Here you go.
- I want eggs, not tomatoes!

00:27:49.309 --> 00:27:53.716
It feels so good,
like we're a family eating together.

00:27:56.482 --> 00:27:58.217
But let me tell you about this guy.

00:27:58.217 --> 00:27:59.927
When I asked him to buy cigarettes for me,

00:27:59.927 --> 00:28:02.430
I told him I'd introduce him to my daughter.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:03.890
He said, "Don't bother."

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.726
"No need."

00:28:06.726 --> 00:28:09.065
Do you regret it now?

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:14.152
A little.

00:28:14.152 --> 00:28:18.137
He said, "A little."

00:28:18.137 --> 00:28:20.077
A little.

00:28:23.384 --> 00:28:26.746
- No way. You dropped it again.
- You're acting strange today.

00:28:26.746 --> 00:28:28.876
- I'm fine.
- You dropped an egg while cooking.

00:28:28.876 --> 00:28:32.254
Now you dropped your chopsticks.

00:28:32.877 --> 00:28:35.180
Eat more. Do you want some soup?

00:28:55.122 --> 00:28:58.982
[Zhou Xiao Qi: Where are you?]

00:28:58.982 --> 00:29:05.174
[I'm outside your clinic.]

00:29:16.562 --> 00:29:19.048
Your call has been forwarded to voicemail.

00:29:19.048 --> 00:29:21.512
Please leave a message after the beep.

00:29:23.695 --> 00:29:27.557
Sorry, the number you dialed is unavailable.

00:29:27.557 --> 00:29:29.602
Please try again later.

00:29:36.816 --> 00:29:38.526
Thank you for today.

00:29:38.526 --> 00:29:41.971
My mom seems to like you a lot.
She's smiling so happily.

00:29:41.971 --> 00:29:44.558
I'm a good son-in-law, right?

00:29:45.216 --> 00:29:47.744
She likes to joke around.
Don't take it seriously.

00:29:47.744 --> 00:29:50.204
She always makes me angry
and laugh at the same time.

00:29:50.204 --> 00:29:53.416
But I can't let her see me snickering,
or she'll make it worse.

00:29:53.416 --> 00:29:55.087
Your mom is much more interesting than mine.

00:29:55.087 --> 00:29:57.781
My mom scolds me even when I joke around.

00:29:59.605 --> 00:30:01.966
Your mom must be displeased with me.

00:30:01.966 --> 00:30:06.304
She must want you to break up
with this fake girlfriend, right?

00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:08.517
My mom has never been happy
with any of my girlfriends.

00:30:08.517 --> 00:30:09.583
Don't care about her.

00:30:09.583 --> 00:30:11.310
If I like whoever, only my opinion matters.

00:30:15.897 --> 00:30:17.231
Be careful.

00:30:24.405 --> 00:30:26.575
Get home safely.

00:30:27.508 --> 00:30:29.702
Go back first.

00:30:29.702 --> 00:30:31.538
You should leave first.

00:30:33.414 --> 00:30:34.873
Bye.

00:30:51.365 --> 00:30:55.545
My friend said to spice things up a bit.

00:30:55.545 --> 00:30:57.755
It might help.

00:31:12.662 --> 00:31:14.457
Is it helping?

00:31:40.122 --> 00:31:42.066
How much longer?

00:31:42.066 --> 00:31:45.027
Bear with it. Just a few more minutes.

00:31:45.027 --> 00:31:48.848
I read online that doctors say this won't work.

00:31:48.848 --> 00:31:53.119
A doctor recommended it to me, too.

00:31:53.119 --> 00:31:55.415
I'd rather believe it.

00:31:57.098 --> 00:32:02.753
By the way, Dr. Wu suggested
that we go to the hospital for a checkup.

00:32:02.753 --> 00:32:05.239
Maybe there's a better way.

00:32:05.239 --> 00:32:07.034
What do you think?

00:32:15.474 --> 00:32:18.160
Do you want to stay here tonight?

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.482
I have something on tomorrow.

00:32:20.482 --> 00:32:22.357
I have to go.

[Lynx Collection]

00:33:16.619 --> 00:33:18.037
Hey.

00:33:19.705 --> 00:33:21.291
Speaking.

00:33:29.899 --> 00:33:31.634
What is it?

00:33:31.634 --> 00:33:33.094
A patient shoplifted.

00:33:33.094 --> 00:33:34.194
The shop owner called the police.

00:33:34.194 --> 00:33:35.246
They're at the police station now.

00:33:35.246 --> 00:33:37.473
I'll go take care of it.

00:33:37.473 --> 00:33:38.920
Okay.

00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:13.634
Hello, I'm here for Ms. Zhou Xiao Qi.

00:34:13.634 --> 00:34:15.135
She's over there.

00:34:28.416 --> 00:34:30.985
Hi, I'm Ms. Zhou's psychiatrist.

00:34:30.985 --> 00:34:32.445
Your ID, please.

00:34:38.134 --> 00:34:43.939
Ms. Zhou said she has a history
of stealing and sees you.

00:34:43.939 --> 00:34:46.527
The diagnosis is kleptomania.

00:34:47.852 --> 00:34:50.755
It's an impulse control disorder.

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:54.842
They use the thrill of stealing
to divert their anxiety.

00:34:54.842 --> 00:34:59.930
But can she please control herself,
or she'll cause trouble.

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:02.433
I'll take down the details.
Please wait over there.

00:35:02.433 --> 00:35:03.725
Thank you.

00:35:24.416 --> 00:35:30.284
I thought stealing a lighter was just
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

00:35:33.964 --> 00:35:36.217
I didn't know you were a habitual thief.

00:35:38.778 --> 00:35:43.990
When I can't have something,
I want to steal it.

00:35:45.701 --> 00:35:50.339
Don't try to justify your outburst
and get away with it.

00:35:50.339 --> 00:35:53.067
Don't forget that you're not my psychiatrist.

00:35:59.031 --> 00:36:00.982
You'll end up in jail.

00:36:03.285 --> 00:36:05.058
Do you care?

00:36:32.133 --> 00:36:37.862
[Zhou Xiao Qi]

00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:47.372
James, your sperm count is indeed low.

00:36:48.264 --> 00:36:51.096
If you want to conceive
through traditional methods,

00:36:51.096 --> 00:36:53.020
the chances are very low.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:56.213
I suggest we try artificial insemination first.

00:36:56.213 --> 00:36:59.408
If that doesn't work,
we'll consider in vitro fertilization.

00:36:59.408 --> 00:37:00.994
What do you think?

00:37:03.362 --> 00:37:05.139
Let's do as you say.

00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:08.667
Just leave it to my expertise.

00:37:09.618 --> 00:37:12.229
Please arrange for Ms. Zhou
to have a basic checkup.

00:37:12.229 --> 00:37:14.148
Okay.

00:37:14.148 --> 00:37:15.841
How long will the checkup take?

00:37:15.841 --> 00:37:18.544
I have an important meeting.

00:37:18.544 --> 00:37:20.738
It's okay. Go ahead.

00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:22.639
It's just a checkup.

00:37:23.465 --> 00:37:25.676
I'll let Xin Tong stay with you.

00:37:25.676 --> 00:37:27.790
Tell her if you need anything.

00:37:29.263 --> 00:37:30.664
Please help speed it up later.

00:37:30.664 --> 00:37:31.957
Okay.

00:37:32.917 --> 00:37:34.360
We'll draw five vials of blood.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.015
It will hurt a little, so bear with it.

You can get off work.
I still have something on.

00:38:59.128 --> 00:39:02.293
Have you ever missed someone so much
that you couldn't eat or sleep?

I'm not afraid.

What's there to worry about?

00:42:10.277 --> 00:42:12.060
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

00:42:12.946 --> 00:42:15.969
Whenever I miss you, I steal something.

00:42:17.451 --> 00:42:19.788
I can't control myself.

00:42:20.704 --> 00:42:22.066
What about you?

Are you and Pan Xin Tong getting serious?

Maybe.

00:43:32.025 --> 00:43:33.026
Just go with the flow.

00:43:33.026 --> 00:43:34.111
Let nature take its course.

00:43:34.111 --> 00:43:35.488
I've warned you not to
get involved with employees.

00:43:35.488 --> 00:43:36.649
You'll have to find your own staff.

00:43:36.649 --> 00:43:38.740
You're driving me crazy, honestly.

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:41.535
Don't worry. I handle every breakup well.

00:43:41.535 --> 00:43:44.204
We can still be colleagues and friends.

00:43:44.204 --> 00:43:46.898
You always think you handle it well,
but the girls are heartbroken.

00:43:46.898 --> 00:43:48.903
They even call me crying.

00:43:50.477 --> 00:43:52.337
But that's not my problem.

00:43:52.337 --> 00:43:54.308
All my breakups were amicable.

00:43:54.308 --> 00:43:55.424
How was I supposed to know?

00:43:55.424 --> 00:43:57.634
You never date anyone
for more than three months.

00:43:57.634 --> 00:43:58.721
Who could stand that?

00:43:58.721 --> 00:44:00.304
You should just be clear from the start.

00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:02.264
It wouldn't be wonderful if I did.

00:44:02.264 --> 00:44:03.849
I just follow my feelings.

00:44:03.849 --> 00:44:06.351
It just happens to be around three months.

00:44:06.351 --> 00:44:08.854
If we force it, all that's left is fighting.

00:44:08.854 --> 00:44:12.190
Isn't it better to end it at the best moment?

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:13.943
- Quit while you're ahead.
- Exactly.

00:44:13.943 --> 00:44:15.777
That makes sense.

00:44:15.777 --> 00:44:17.555
- It really does.
- Right?

Yes.

Why aren't you replying to my messages?

You're stealing.

If I reply, I become an accomplice.

00:44:32.336 --> 00:44:34.254
You are an accomplice.

00:44:39.676 --> 00:44:41.867
I'm going to report you to the police.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.657
I want to hug you.

00:45:19.466 --> 00:45:21.062
It's nothing.

Oh, so handsome.
