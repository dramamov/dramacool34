00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.480
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.960
I was just looking for you.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.840
What is it?

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.920
Do you have an antidote?

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.640
What antidote?

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.080
The medicine you gave me today.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.600
You already gave it to me.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.600
Why do you need an antidote now?

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.000
I'm regretting it now.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.280
It's a human life, after all.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.240
Give me the antidote, quickly.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.880
There's no antidote for this.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.600
Besides,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.280
You told me to use a strong dose.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.680
So I used a full dose.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.760
One packet is enough.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.520
That's fatal.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.120
Even if there was an antidote,

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.320
it would be too late.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.560
Why?

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.040
What should I do?

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.760
If nothing works,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.560
try to find a way to help him recover.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.960
Enough.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.320
My lord.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.200
Let's go.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.240
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.920
I was just about to.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.720
Then don't go.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.800
I've prepared a special meal for you.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.560
Big Brother's agarwood—

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.200
It's not that, so eat without worry.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.000
This time it's really to nourish you.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.920
Come.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.160
Try this.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.680
You call this

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.280
proper nourishment?

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.520
Ten Complete Great Tonifying Soup.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.360
This—

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.520
Green jade and gold.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.440
And this one—

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.320
Xitang braised eel.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.080
How is this not proper?

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.200
Don't be shy.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.160
Eat as much as you want.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.640
If it's not enough, I'll make more.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.400
You—

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.160
Are you feeling alright?

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.200
I just woke up this morning

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.280
with a bit of a headache.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.320
And then—

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.160
Here, finish this bowl.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.640
I'm going to be late for court.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.680
Grab a lunchbox from the kitchen and eat on the way.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.960
Thank you, My Lady.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.120
Liang Jin.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.520
Yes.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.520
I'll go right away.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.920
Such a good soup—

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.360
It would be a waste.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.080
I'll eat it.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.320
Miss Nan truly is a heroine among women.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.880
She's really bold.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.520
But why is she suddenly trying to nourish My Lord?

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.920
She was so indifferent just the other day.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.560
Isn't it said

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.240
that a woman's temper

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.960
is like spring weather—

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.360
always changing?

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.880
That's probably it.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.000
My lord.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.680
Have some food.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.440
No, no.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.560
I have no appetite.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.840
Tonight,

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.080
clear out the people from Yuqing Pavilion.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.160
Yes, My Lord.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.880
Rui Manor even has hot springs.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.640
Such a fine stream flows through here.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.440
Who knows how much was embezzled.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.760
Yuqing Pavilion—

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.320
seems truly deserted.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.440
It's quite comfortable.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.720
You—

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.840
Why are you here?

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.160
Why is My Lady here?

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.360
You're not in the study?

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.760
I've been a bit tired lately.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.640
So,

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.680
I thought I'd come to relax.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.000
Then I'll step out first.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.600
You go ahead.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.080
I'm really sorry.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.480
Alright.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.600
Do not look at what is improper.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.480
I understand.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.440
I understand.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.120
This—

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.680
Had too much tonic this morning.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:35.880
It really invigorates the blood.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.360
She didn't see anything, did she?

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.680
Did you notice anything unusual?

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.600
You've been watching for so long.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.960
We're heading out soon.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.480
Isn't Rui Yu a treacherous minister?

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.160
How has he tolerated me for so long?

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.560
Your Majesty granted this marriage.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.360
Would he dare to divorce you so easily?

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.160
He'd at least wait a year or two.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.840
If you have no child in two years,

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.120
you can request a mutual divorce.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.080
Two years—

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.520
That's hard to endure.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.120
Don't think about it, don't think.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:42.920
Still have to separate.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.840
I watched Rui Yu grow up.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.160
Your Majesty granted him this marriage.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.840
I'm extremely dissatisfied.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.520
But there's nothing I can do.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.240
You've noticed it too.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.000
Your Majesty wants to promote the military officers.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:56.960
A few days ago,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.000
he even told me

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:58.680
to

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.600
increase troops and expand the military.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.440
This—

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.520
isn't it a waste of resources?

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.200
Rui Yu is here.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:11.960
Student.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.240
Greetings, Master.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.840
You came at just the right time.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.520
I was just talking with your father.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.520
We were discussing your marriage.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.120
Is there anything wrong with that?

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.320
Your Majesty wants you to marry.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.960
Have you thought about why that is?

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.480
I believe

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.160
Your Majesty's decision

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.960
is to promote civil-military harmony.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.120
Restore the military officials.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.160
Among the three kingdoms,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.400
there's only been peace for a dozen years.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.200
If we restore the military hastily,

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.080
what will the other two kingdoms think?

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.480
If war breaks out again,

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.760
then

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.800
wouldn't the Rui family be blamed for it?

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.360
If the military gains a place in court,

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.920
and can restrain Qian Yuan and Pingxiang

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.960
without bloodshed,

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.800
it would be a merit for our Rui family.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.560
That would be a great achievement.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.280
Now you are tasked with overseeing the Spring Imperial Examination.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.480
Perhaps Your Majesty

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.880
intends to use a civil-military marriage alliance

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.560
to promote the Military Imperial Examination.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.640
Using a civil-military marriage alliance

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
to advance the Military Imperial Examination.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.200
If that's truly the case,

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.760
then if Rui Yu and I divorce,

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.720
wouldn't that ruin everything?

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.560
Now that Rui Yu is married,

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.240
let's give Your Majesty some time.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:38.680
If

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.320
as Rui Yu said, peace can be kept without bloodshed,

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.800
then it's fine.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.480
But

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.360
if anything changes,

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.680
if Miss Nan is not the right person,

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.160
I

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.360
will join the six ministers

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.280
to help Rui Yu seek a mutual divorce.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:00.800
Then

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.680
I must trouble you, Grand Councilor.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.240
What should I do?

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.400
Pretend to be loving with Rui Yu

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.280
to maintain the civil-military alliance?

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.720
But my identity...

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.240
My Lady,

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.280
sorry to keep you waiting.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.440
Let's go.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:25.480
Alright.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.320
This must be Miss Nan.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.080
Darn it.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.120
Greetings, Grand Councilor.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.120
I didn't know you were coming.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.160
I failed to welcome you.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.680
That was truly discourteous.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.520
Please don't take offense.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:44.920
It's fine.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:51.960
Master.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:52.640
Father.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.800
It's getting late.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.040
My Lady and I need to deliver a return gift.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.240
We'll take our leave.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:58.560
Go ahead.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.920
I'll continue talking with your father.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.040
We'll chat a bit more.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.040
My Lord,

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.160
are you alright?

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.520
I'm fine.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.360
Be careful.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.000
This marriage—

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:25.960
I'm not divorcing.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.240
And

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.400
I want to be

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.320
a good wife.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.600
Da Bai,

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.720
you must be starving.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.760
I'll get you something tasty soon.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.600
You scared me to death.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.600
What are you doing?

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.280
Where did you come from?

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:44.920
Big Brother,

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:45.960
are you hungry?

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.200
Have some snacks.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.200
I'll cook later.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.120
You're cooking again?

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.200
I heard at Yun Shui Jian

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.600
there's some new peach blossom wine.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.600
I'll have someone

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.880
Why is it you?

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:19.800
Come over here.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.280
What is it, Madam?

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.120
Take this horse

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.160
to the stable.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.120
Yes, Madam.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:24.960
Wait.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.600
Elder sister-in-law, let me.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:43.920
Let me do it.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:45.560
Big Brother.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:46.680
I'll help you dig.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.320
Are you a ghost?

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.320
Big Brother.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.080
Done.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.520
You can bury it now.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.840
That nearly killed me.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:06.480
Yu'er,

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.640
you're finally back.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.240
What's going on?

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.280
Quick, take her away.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:23.600
My Lord,

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.360
are you taking me out?

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
You don't want to take me?

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.760
On this trip,

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.760
I have other important matters.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.120
Publicly,

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.160
traveling with My Lady is just a cover.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.840
I hope My Lady understands.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.440
This journey is full of danger.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.560
I don't want you to be at risk.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:47.760
Even less

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.520
do I want you dragged into court intrigue.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:51.920
Danger?

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:53.800
As a general's daughter,

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.080
I've never feared such things.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.560
I face blades and swords head-on.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.000
That's not what I meant.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.320
Do you also look down on us

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.960
military folk like the civil officials do?

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:04.960
In peaceful times,

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.800
soldiers are kept for years, never used.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.320
Military men are seen as

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.240
mere fools playing with weapons.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.200
I never meant that.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.160
Though the world is peaceful now,

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.760
if not for soldiers guarding the borders,

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:18.800
never slacking off,

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.840
how could the people live in peace?

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.400
I hope there will be no more wars.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.920
And that good generals remain.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.320
In short,

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.880
if we act, we must play the part fully.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.120
I must go.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.120
I...

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:39.560
Alright.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.680
I'll have Liang Jin

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.160
help you pack your things.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.560
Court politics are full of intrigue.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.160
Who can truly stay out of it?

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.000
What did My Lady say?

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.320
I said,

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.600
I'm bringing Fu Lü with me.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.360
Alright.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:03.640
My Lord.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.000
For this trip,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.640
Why is Fu Lü coming too?

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:14.600
Fu Lü,

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.480
catch a butterfly for me.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.400
That's impressive!

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.200
I taught her Ti Yun Zong.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.280
How is it?

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.600
Fu Lü has other uses too.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.040
You'll see on the road.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.120
Let's go, Fu Lü.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:55.960
Announce.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.440
Prince Pan requests an audience.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.320
Pan Zi Zhai of Qian Yuan.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.320
Greetings, Your Majesty of Ling An.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:05.960
No need for formalities.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.120
Grand Councilor is here too.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:10.760
Prince.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.240
Prince Pan wishes to discuss matters with Your Majesty.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.000
Then,

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.840
I shall take my leave.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:17.680
Li Quan.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.160
Yes.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.400
Escort the Grand Councilor out.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.120
Yes.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.360
You entered the palace today—

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.880
Is there something you wish to discuss?

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.920
Nothing major.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.320
Qian Yuan sent some leather goods and gems.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.720
I wish to present them to Your Majesty.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.160
Prince Pan is thoughtful.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.920
You've been in Ling An

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.680
for quite a few years now.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.280
This year

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.640
marks the nineteenth year.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.600
So that means,

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.720
you should've returned nine years ago.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.160
Yes.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.360
But Qian Yuan hasn't had a new royal heir.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.040
Naturally,

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.880
there's no new royal blood to exchange with me.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.920
Living in a foreign land,

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.760
one needs something to hold onto.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.960
You've been in Jingdu Cheng for years.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.840
You must have made many friends here.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.360
I usually just

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.800
go wherever there's a banquet.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.000
Join the fun.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.200
Always leave drunk.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.640
I don't really have close friends.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:18.800
Except

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.920
I sometimes visit the Rui family

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.160
to see my aunt.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.600
I almost forgot—

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.880
your mother was from Ling An.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.160
In a way,

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.440
it's like returning to your roots.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.280
Just as Your Majesty said,

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:35.880
when I first arrived in Ling An,

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.320
I felt a sense of belonging.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:38.840
I

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:39.960
stay deep within the palace,

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.360
rarely have a chance to leave.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:42.800
Outside the palace,

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.760
have you heard any interesting stories?

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.440
I've heard

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.080
Pingxiang has a unique dyeing technique.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.640
It can dye one cloth in four colors.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.160
When made into a skirt, under sunlight

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.160
it's quite magical.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.280
It looks like a fairy's attire.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.240
This tiny country,

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.040
is truly charming.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.080
It seems Prince Pan

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.360
is quite interested in Pingxiang.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.000
If a place is interesting,

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.680
I'm always willing to learn about it.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.040
Your Majesty,

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.040
these are pastries made by the imperial chef.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.280
Take them and have a taste.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.440
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.720
I'm feeling a bit tired.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.720
I won't keep you for a meal.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.120
You jest, Your Majesty.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.280
Li Quan.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:26.840
Yes.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.080
Escort Prince Pan out.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:28.640
Yes.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.760
This way, Prince Pan.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.320
Your Majesty.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.400
He's left.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.200
Gone.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.920
Prince Pan is polite.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.200
He wouldn't let me escort him.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.280
Servant.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.840
He let Li Zhong do it.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.840
He's quite thorough.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:04.760
Your Majesty,

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.840
send more men to watch the Hostage Residence.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.920
Keep a close eye on Pan Zi Zhai's every move.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.000
I'll arrange it right away.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.960
It's clearly daytime,

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.360
but no vendors are in the streets.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.000
Strange.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:33.440
My Lady.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:37.880
Slow down.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.760
Riding in the carriage is exhausting.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.480
Let's go inside and rest.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.400
Go in and take a look.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.280
Yes.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.080
Who is it?

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.280
We're from Jingdu Cheng.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.520
Jingdu Cheng?

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.080
Yes, yes.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.200
It's Lord Rui!

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.560
I was just cleaning up.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.000
Sorry for not greeting you sooner.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.640
Please forgive me, Lord Rui.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:10.800
Lead the way.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.080
Please, come inside.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:13.360
Please.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.840
Except for our group,

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.680
is anyone else staying here?

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.160
No one else.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:31.880
This humble official

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.560
cleared out the post station especially

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.000
to welcome Your Lordship and My Lady.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.800
You are quite thoughtful.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.840
To serve Your Lordship

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.600
is a blessing beyond measure.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.320
The best room upstairs

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.080
has been prepared for you both.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.520
On the left is Tianshu Pavilion,

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.400
and on the right is Tianxuan Pavilion.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.960
We as husband and wife

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.280
can share one room.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:00.800
Mainly,

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.680
the beds here are not large.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.280
I'm worried you may not be used to it.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:04.840
So,

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.200
that's why I arranged it this way.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.520
What does My Lady think?

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:12.920
You prefer quiet.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.440
You should take the west room.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:15.880
Alright.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.760
Then go upstairs and rest.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.080
Lord Rui,

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:29.560
Well,

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.400
this humble official

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.480
will take my leave as well.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.560
Young Prince,

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:02.920
please.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.320
Did you need something from me?

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.480
I want to go out for a walk.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.800
Would you like to come with me?

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.480
I'll stay here.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.200
It's safer to remain at the post station.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:24.920
Alright.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.440
If I see something interesting,

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.040
I'll bring it back for you.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.120
Then take care of yourself.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.280
By the way,

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:34.680
this is

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.080
the short sword my Big Brother left me.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:37.680
Keep it for your protection.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.120
No wonder on your wedding day

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.680
you insisted on carrying it.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.880
Such an important item

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.120
isn't right for me to have.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.360
Why not?

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.440
You are my husband.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:48.840
Your safety matters most.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.200
Take it.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.200
Well,

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.400
thank you.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:57.960
I'm off.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:17.960
A toast to you.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:19.520
Honored guest,

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.160
you've arrived.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.400
Please come inside.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:25.680
Honored guest,

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:26.400
please have a seat.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.200
Honored guest,

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.360
what would you like to order?

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:36.800
Two taels of beef

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:37.680
and a pot of rice wine.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:38.800
Alright.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:39.720
It'll be ready soon.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:40.840
My batch of goods

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.960
can't be sold in Pingxiang now.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.840
We sell our own goods.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.560
What does it matter to the King of Pingxiang?

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.320
You know as well as I do,

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.080
the King's brother, Hou Qi,

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.200
is cruel and ruthless.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.520
He has always hated our country.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.120
Now he governs in the King's stead.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.320
We should avoid him if we can.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.920
Where could you possibly hide?

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.360
Still, we have to try.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:02.320
Tell me,

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.400
the King of Pingxiang has a son.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:05.960
No matter what,

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.040
Hou Qi shouldn't inherit the throne.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.400
Brother,

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.040
you don't know yet.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.200
The King's heir was badly injured while hunting.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.280
His fate is still uncertain.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.560
I'm telling you,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:19.680
anyway,

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:20.760
tomorrow

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.560
I'm heading to Qian Yuan instead.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.840
If things go wrong with Pingxiang,

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:28.120
it'll be hard to find a place in Qian Yuan.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.520
So that's Rui Yu's plan.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:32.840
Fire!

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.640
The post station is on fire!

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.200
The post station!

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:36.080
Rui Yu!

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.760
Fire! Fire!

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.520
Rui Yu!

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:45.680
Your Lordship!

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.040
Young Prince, hide quickly!

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:52.800
Rui Yu!

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.160
My Lady!

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:16.720
Let's go!

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.080
Young Prince, hurry!

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.560
We can't escape like this.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.160
Fu Lü!

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.320
Take the Young Prince that way.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:30.360
We'll distract the pursuers.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.040
Alright.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:31.560
Go!

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:33.480
Go!

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:37.200
Chase them!

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:43.600
Over there!

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:44.400
Hurry!

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.520
Chase!

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:49.480
Go!

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:52.600
Over there!

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:53.960
Stop running!

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:54.920
Freeze!

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:55.680
You can't escape now.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.480
What should we do?

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.880
There's no way out.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.200
Careful!

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.360
Chen Xiao!

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.320
You hide first.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.480
Once they catch me, they won't act rashly.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.400
There may still be hope.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:12.720
Jump off the cliff!

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.040
Go, quickly!

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:30.640
What now?

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.320
I'll go back and report.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.080
The rest search below.

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:32.520
Search below!

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.080
Yes!

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:35.920
Hold on a bit longer.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:39.360
It's alright.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.200
There's a cave ahead.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:45.280
Go!

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:45.800
Go!

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:48.720
Careful!

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.160
Careful!

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.200
My Lady

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.120
Be careful.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:10.320
The arrow is poisoned.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.480
You just exerted force.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.880
I'm afraid the poison
has entered your heart meridian.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.200
It's poisoned.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.400
Rui Yu,

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.520
I have a secret to tell you.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.160
Let me treat your wound first.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.240
We can talk slowly.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:29.880
Listen to me first.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:32.840
Alright.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.320
Go ahead.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.760
I once saved your life.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.120
You won't forget your debt, will you?

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.720
I surely won't.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:43.800
Alright.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.240
This secret

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.760
I will only tell you.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.760
Actually, I...

00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.400
am a man.
