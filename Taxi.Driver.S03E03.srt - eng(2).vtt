How come it doesn't feel like we're cleaning this together?

00:00:56.595 --> 00:00:59.005
That's because you're so selfish.

00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:01.535
- Selfish? - Yes.

00:01:01.635 --> 00:01:05.545
- Me? But where are you? - I'm in your heart, you rascal.

- No, we haven't sold it yet. - Why not? Is it still being fixed?

The repairs were finished ages ago.

But when it came time to sell it... I don't know.

00:01:21.725 --> 00:01:23.695
It's hard to let go.

- I know, right? - So you're just going to keep it?

Got it?

No, not at all. Please, don't say that.

- Don't come out. - But...

00:07:54.085 --> 00:07:57.725
Yes, I can be there in 10 minutes. And the fee is 30 dollars.

Okay, I'll be right there. Yes, thank you.

- Gosh, talk about eagle eyes. - Even I can see that.

00:08:33.085 --> 00:08:35.925
But "scratch" is such a harsh word for that little blemish.

00:08:35.995 --> 00:08:38.695
I'd call it a beauty mark. Just a tiny one.

Right. It was in a huge accident, so we just...

00:09:06.125 --> 00:09:09.625
Because he's such a careful and delicate driver.

00:09:10.625 --> 00:09:12.565
I see a few accidents on its record, though.

00:09:14.035 --> 00:09:16.735
Yes, but they were nothing. Just minor fender-benders.

00:09:18.705 --> 00:09:21.605
I can't even remember now. Was it just a little scrape?

00:09:21.675 --> 00:09:24.005
What are you talking about? The repair bills were thousands...

00:09:26.875 --> 00:09:30.645
He's a very careful driver. A really meticulous guy.

00:09:32.315 --> 00:09:34.955
Hey, we can't lie about this.

00:09:35.055 --> 00:09:37.255

Here's something even you can't deny.

00:09:45.125 --> 00:09:48.235
Sir, buying this car means...

00:09:48.965 --> 00:09:51.105
you're not just buying a car, you're buying our memories.

00:09:51.535 --> 00:09:55.005
He's right about that. It holds many special memories.

00:09:56.235 --> 00:09:57.235
All right, I get it.

00:09:58.945 --> 00:10:00.205
Memories. That's nice.

00:10:00.605 --> 00:10:04.645
We'll add 1,000 for the "memories" and buy it for a total of 11,000.

So what, we just have to keep waiting?

00:11:12.445 --> 00:11:13.445
He'll be back.

00:11:13.885 --> 00:11:15.815
He's probably just driving and can't pick up.

00:11:17.285 --> 00:11:18.625
Let's just wait a little longer.

00:11:20.025 --> 00:11:21.055
All right.

00:11:26.495 --> 00:11:27.495

It was his plan all along.

00:12:03.295 --> 00:12:04.665
Then just give him a call.

00:12:04.735 --> 00:12:08.035
We already did! Gyeong Gu and I kept calling him.

00:12:43.535 --> 00:12:44.575
Hang on a second.

00:12:46.645 --> 00:12:49.315
Yes, Driver Oh. I've been waiting for your call.

00:12:49.445 --> 00:12:52.614
- I won't need to borrow that money. - What?

00:12:52.615 --> 00:12:54.515
Sorry to have worried you for nothing.

00:12:54.885 --> 00:12:57.485
- You're busy, so I'll let you go. - Wait, Driver Oh.

00:13:05.595 --> 00:13:07.325
Go Eun, you know Driver Oh, right?

00:13:07.365 --> 00:13:10.595
Look up Driver Oh's home address and text it to me right away.

00:13:10.695 --> 00:13:11.865
- Yes, sir. - But...

00:13:12.465 --> 00:13:14.375
- Go Eun... - Gosh, just go dry yourselves off.

00:13:14.675 --> 00:13:15.675
But...

00:13:18.505 --> 00:13:20.675
Hey, looks like Mr. Jang is leaving. What do we do?

00:13:21.875 --> 00:13:22.945
Should we wait?

00:13:23.115 --> 00:13:26.545
- He said to hang on, so let's wait. - Okay.

00:13:40.295 --> 00:13:42.395
- Ji Eun, you're home. - Hello, sir.

00:13:42.465 --> 00:13:43.465
Is your mom home?

00:13:43.535 --> 00:13:46.565
My mom's not feeling well. She took medicine and is sleeping.

00:13:47.565 --> 00:13:49.005
- Please, come in. - Thanks.

00:13:53.205 --> 00:13:56.075
So your dad had an accident working as a designated driver?

00:13:58.245 --> 00:13:59.785
He broke his wrist,

00:14:00.345 --> 00:14:02.555
so he had surgery and is in the hospital now.

00:14:02.815 --> 00:14:06.085
But I thought he was doing well with his private taxi.

00:14:06.225 --> 00:14:09.855
I didn't know Dad was a designated driver until the accident.

00:14:11.165 --> 00:14:12.325
Oh, dear.

00:14:14.195 --> 00:14:15.195
And...

00:14:18.305 --> 00:14:20.165
I found this in his drawer.

00:14:21.935 --> 00:14:24.975
Hey, these are divorce papers.

00:14:25.945 --> 00:14:28.645
I have no idea what's going through his head.

00:14:29.575 --> 00:14:31.145
He won't answer me when I ask.

00:14:32.485 --> 00:14:33.945
Which hospital is your dad in right now?

00:14:43.855 --> 00:14:44.925

00:15:19.525 --> 00:15:20.665
Driver Oh!

00:15:22.595 --> 00:15:23.595
Driver Oh!

00:15:24.165 --> 00:15:25.565
Driver Oh, wait!

00:15:28.275 --> 00:15:29.275
Driver Oh.

00:15:30.175 --> 00:15:33.505
I don't know what's going on, but please, just talk to me.

00:15:34.515 --> 00:15:36.015
There's no other way.

00:15:38.315 --> 00:15:39.945
I have to die right here.

00:15:40.415 --> 00:15:42.915
- It'll all be over. - What do you mean, be over?

00:15:45.325 --> 00:15:46.625
What about the people you'll leave behind?

00:15:47.355 --> 00:15:49.595
The pain you're going through right now!

00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:53.825
The people left behind will carry that pain, only magnified.

00:15:55.765 --> 00:15:57.805
They'll have to carry that weight for the rest of their lives.

00:15:58.065 --> 00:15:59.235
Are you okay with that?

00:16:01.975 --> 00:16:02.975
Just come here.

00:16:03.635 --> 00:16:04.675
I'll help you.

00:16:05.675 --> 00:16:06.675
Okay?

00:16:07.245 --> 00:16:10.945
There's nothing more I can do.

00:16:11.485 --> 00:16:12.785
That's not true!

00:16:14.085 --> 00:16:16.615
There are always other options.

00:16:17.655 --> 00:16:20.655
There is so much you can still do. All right?

00:16:22.295 --> 00:16:23.295
I...

00:16:24.565 --> 00:16:26.925
Those jerks got me,

00:16:28.135 --> 00:16:30.795
and there's no way out.

00:16:33.835 --> 00:16:34.975
Please...

00:16:39.145 --> 00:16:40.575
Please just take my hand.

00:16:42.315 --> 00:16:43.475
Hey. Come on.

00:17:08.805 --> 00:17:11.005
It's all right. You're okay.

00:17:11.745 --> 00:17:12.745
You're okay.

00:17:18.145 --> 00:17:19.515
Whatever happened,

00:17:20.545 --> 00:17:22.085
you can tell me everything.

00:17:23.115 --> 00:17:24.115
Everything.

(Driver Test Evaluation Report)

00:17:33.395 --> 00:17:34.795
Looks like all your paperwork is in order.

00:17:35.765 --> 00:17:36.765
But...

00:17:37.465 --> 00:17:39.365
What is it? Are you not happy with the price?

00:17:39.565 --> 00:17:42.505
No, it's just much lower than I expected.

00:17:51.645 --> 00:17:53.085
So a low price is a problem now?

00:17:54.715 --> 00:17:57.355
I'm sorry if it came off that way.

00:17:59.825 --> 00:18:02.455
Right now, the going rate for a Seoul taxi number...

00:18:02.925 --> 00:18:06.065
is trading at about 120,000 dollars, give or take 5,000.

00:18:06.965 --> 00:18:10.265
This particular license is for sale due to the owner's poor health.

00:18:10.435 --> 00:18:12.205
So it came to us as a distress sale.

00:18:12.605 --> 00:18:15.375
So we listed it at a 25-percent discount off the market rate,

00:18:15.435 --> 00:18:17.375
and you were the very first person to call.

00:18:18.145 --> 00:18:22.145
I was scrolling through listings, and yours suddenly popped up.

00:18:22.315 --> 00:18:24.115
So I knew I had to jump on it right away.

00:18:24.175 --> 00:18:25.645
Look, I have another appointment to get to,

00:18:26.045 --> 00:18:27.985
so I'll just assume you're withdrawing your offer,

00:18:28.055 --> 00:18:29.915
and I'll contact the next person on the waiting list right away.

00:18:30.015 --> 00:18:31.655
Goodness, withdraw?

00:18:32.325 --> 00:18:33.325
Of course not.

00:18:33.685 --> 00:18:36.125
The owner wants to have cash in hand by the end of the day.

00:18:36.195 --> 00:18:38.365
If we waste time, we both lose, don't we?

00:18:39.025 --> 00:18:40.065
Right. I understand.

00:18:40.865 --> 00:18:43.295
I'll take the deal.

00:18:47.205 --> 00:18:48.374
- Manager Yang. - Yes, sir.

00:18:48.375 --> 00:18:49.404
His papers check out,

00:18:49.405 --> 00:18:50.805
- so process with the contract. - Yes, sir.

00:18:51.845 --> 00:18:53.975
- Assistant Manager Yoo, you there? - Yes, sir.

00:18:54.075 --> 00:18:56.915
Pull the taxi out front so it's easy for him to leave.

00:18:57.215 --> 00:18:58.345
Right away, sir.

00:19:01.755 --> 00:19:04.285
I'm sorry to rush off. My next appointment is tight.

00:19:04.455 --> 00:19:07.385
Not at all. I'm the one who held you up.

00:19:07.525 --> 00:19:08.525
My apologies.

00:19:12.365 --> 00:19:13.365
Oh, right.

00:19:13.825 --> 00:19:16.365
- Make a separate cashback contract. - Right.

00:19:16.595 --> 00:19:19.865
My manager here will explain it all. Just listen to him and sign.

00:19:20.535 --> 00:19:22.305
- All right, then. - Okay.

00:19:23.535 --> 00:19:24.535
Take care, sir.

00:19:28.445 --> 00:19:29.575
Hello, there. It's a pleasure.

That was Cha Byeong Jin, the owner, right?

00:19:36.515 --> 00:19:38.485
Yes, that's our boss.

00:19:38.955 --> 00:19:40.255
And is that for real?

00:19:40.855 --> 00:19:43.525
Absolutely. Our boss,

00:19:43.895 --> 00:19:46.495
is indeed a lawyer who passed the Bar Exam.

00:19:46.865 --> 00:19:49.495
- Is that right? - He's so passionate about cars...

00:19:50.135 --> 00:19:52.705
that he decided to run this dealership himself.

00:19:53.105 --> 00:19:55.175
A total gearhead.

00:19:55.535 --> 00:19:57.075
Hearing that he's a lawyer...

00:19:57.505 --> 00:20:00.175
- inspires trust. - All right, have a seat.

00:20:00.675 --> 00:20:04.785
All right, let me explain the cashback contract.

00:20:05.415 --> 00:20:06.445
Cashback?

00:20:07.485 --> 00:20:10.255
If we report the sale at a price that's well below the market rate,

00:20:10.315 --> 00:20:14.125
others in our industry would see it as disrupting the market.

00:20:14.325 --> 00:20:18.525
We report the sale at market rate, and then every month,

00:20:18.965 --> 00:20:23.135
- we send cashback to your account. - I see.

00:20:23.195 --> 00:20:25.365
Your private taxi is right out front.

00:20:25.965 --> 00:20:27.035

Congratulations.

00:20:29.405 --> 00:20:31.175
Gosh, this is a nice taxi.

00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:34.505
We buy used cars, so if you know any other drivers looking to sell,

00:20:34.645 --> 00:20:37.245
- please send them our way. - Of course.

00:20:37.815 --> 00:20:40.015
- Great, thank you. - No, we're grateful.

00:20:40.145 --> 00:20:43.015
All right, let's get this wrapped up.

00:20:43.255 --> 00:20:45.255

(Bar Exam Certificate of Qualification, Cha Byeong Jin)

00:20:54.025 --> 00:20:56.895
- But he is a lawyer. - Then why is a lawyer selling cars?

00:20:57.465 --> 00:20:59.365
He was disbarred.

00:20:59.635 --> 00:21:01.575
He killed someone in a drunk driving hit-and-run.

00:21:03.535 --> 00:21:06.505
And he only served six years in prison.

00:21:06.945 --> 00:21:10.145
That he still brazenly displays it even after being disbarred...

00:21:10.445 --> 00:21:12.245
shows how proud he must still be.

00:21:12.485 --> 00:21:15.085
Wait, I have a question.

00:21:15.615 --> 00:21:18.155
Doesn't Driver Oh qualify for his own private taxi license?

00:21:18.485 --> 00:21:20.555
Why would he spend so much money buying one from someone else?

00:21:21.025 --> 00:21:25.525
It's because of the Taxi Cap System. Private taxi licenses are limited.

00:21:25.925 --> 00:21:28.735
So, only when someone turns in their license...

00:21:28.795 --> 00:21:30.835
can a new license be issued.

00:21:32.305 --> 00:21:35.305
Instead of waiting forever for a turn that might never come,

00:21:35.675 --> 00:21:39.275
it's become standard practice to buy a license from a private seller.

00:21:40.505 --> 00:21:45.085
After investing so much money in it, he barely got to use it...

00:21:45.145 --> 00:21:47.314
before it was revoked overnight.

00:21:47.315 --> 00:21:48.885
- Revoked? - Why?

00:21:53.955 --> 00:21:57.095
Honey, wait. You forgot your lunch.

00:21:58.965 --> 00:22:03.195
I made bone broth for your knees. Don't let it go to waste, okay?

00:22:03.265 --> 00:22:06.005
Gosh, I'll have to eat this right after my first fare.

00:22:06.305 --> 00:22:07.305
I'm off.

00:22:07.365 --> 00:22:11.575
You'll get hungry again quickly. Eat it at a proper mealtime, okay?

00:22:12.205 --> 00:22:14.475
- Ji Eun, be careful on the road. - Okay.

00:22:15.745 --> 00:22:17.915
I thought you could finally rest with your own taxi,

00:22:18.285 --> 00:22:19.285
but I guess not.

00:22:19.345 --> 00:22:23.815
I'll pay your loans by graduation so you can study without worries.

Dad, I'll pass the first time, so don't worry.

00:22:30.495 --> 00:22:31.965
Go on, I'll see you later.

00:22:32.995 --> 00:22:34.595

ASD?

00:23:01.425 --> 00:23:03.255
Hey! What do you think you're doing over there?

00:23:03.495 --> 00:23:04.995
Are you the owner of this taxi?

00:23:05.095 --> 00:23:06.925
Yes, I'm the owner of this private taxi.

00:23:07.195 --> 00:23:09.195
So what are you doing with my car?

00:23:09.695 --> 00:23:13.435
Under the Passenger Transport Act, your taxi license has been revoked.

00:23:13.605 --> 00:23:15.805
What? What do you mean, revoked?

00:23:16.005 --> 00:23:18.905
It says here you have a conviction for a drunk driving accident.

00:23:19.145 --> 00:23:20.145
Me?

00:23:21.045 --> 00:23:23.315
There must be some kind of misunderstanding.

00:23:23.645 --> 00:23:25.185
I don't drink at all.

00:23:25.415 --> 00:23:26.745
And what's this about a car accident?

00:23:26.985 --> 00:23:30.415
We're just following orders, sir. We don't know the specifics.

00:23:30.485 --> 00:23:32.255
We will now proceed to confiscate the license plate.

00:23:33.525 --> 00:23:37.225
Please, don't. I'm telling you I've never done anything like that!

00:23:37.425 --> 00:23:38.595
Don't take it up with us.

00:23:38.965 --> 00:23:40.425
Go take it up with the people who sold you the license.

(Another Safe Day)

00:23:50.935 --> 00:23:54.475
my private taxi license was taken away.

00:24:06.025 --> 00:24:08.155
Sir, should I take this ride?

00:24:13.195 --> 00:24:14.965
Hey, you. You remember me, right?

00:24:15.295 --> 00:24:17.895
You guys knew all along, and you tricked me, didn't you?

00:24:18.835 --> 00:24:20.105
Tricked you?

00:24:20.665 --> 00:24:22.935
About what? Sir, can we talk over here?

00:24:26.575 --> 00:24:29.875
- What seems to be the problem? - The old owner had a DUI,

00:24:30.275 --> 00:24:33.285
- so they took my license plate. - Really? Is that what happened?

00:24:34.215 --> 00:24:38.185
He just asked us to sell the license quickly,

00:24:38.285 --> 00:24:40.325
so we simply brokered the deal for a low price.

00:24:41.555 --> 00:24:44.125
- You know how it is. - Stop lying.

00:24:45.395 --> 00:24:46.395
You knew all along.

What do you mean, your hands are tied?

00:25:35.175 --> 00:25:38.385
Though your license was transferred, the law requires its revocation.

00:25:40.915 --> 00:25:43.484
But the previous owner was the one who drank.

00:25:43.485 --> 00:25:45.325
All I did was buy the license,

00:25:45.755 --> 00:25:49.825
so why is my license being revoked? What kind of insane law is that?

00:25:49.955 --> 00:25:51.965
Yes, I understand you feel this is unfair,

00:25:52.295 --> 00:25:53.465
but that's just the way the law is written.

00:25:54.125 --> 00:25:55.135
I'm sorry about this.

00:25:56.565 --> 00:25:59.805
If all you can say is sorry, what am I supposed to do?

00:26:00.035 --> 00:26:02.675
Who else am I supposed to talk to about this?

00:26:04.035 --> 00:26:05.775
You could try inquiring at the relevant government office.

00:26:07.375 --> 00:26:10.745
But if you drive without a license plate even if you're in a rush,

00:26:11.315 --> 00:26:12.685
you can be fined.

00:26:32.565 --> 00:26:35.705

00:26:49.585 --> 00:26:52.825
then who am I supposed to turn to for help?

00:26:53.025 --> 00:26:56.025
I'm afraid you'll have to go to the police station.

00:26:56.195 --> 00:26:59.125
I just told you. I just came from the police station!

00:26:59.865 --> 00:27:03.565
If you truly feel this is unjust, you can file an administrative case.

00:27:03.965 --> 00:27:04.965
Sir.

00:27:05.735 --> 00:27:07.565
Please don't just tell me it can't be done.

00:27:08.035 --> 00:27:10.205
Please just help me this one time. Please?

00:27:12.845 --> 00:27:14.945
Have you spoken with the previous owner?

00:27:16.775 --> 00:27:18.415
The previous owner?

00:27:19.885 --> 00:27:22.485
The previous owner was arrested for the DUI...

00:27:23.055 --> 00:27:24.585
and was in prison.

00:27:25.225 --> 00:27:26.685
He said he was broke,

00:27:27.425 --> 00:27:29.125
so I couldn't even bring up the money.

00:27:31.555 --> 00:27:33.665
- Hello? - Hey, honey.

00:27:33.965 --> 00:27:35.335
Did you get a lot of fares today?

00:27:38.235 --> 00:27:40.305
Yes, today...

00:27:41.605 --> 00:27:44.205
By the way, how was the bone broth? You finished it all, right?

00:27:44.305 --> 00:27:46.805
Yes, it was delicious.

00:27:47.475 --> 00:27:48.945
Of course it was. Who do you think made it?

00:27:49.475 --> 00:27:53.145
- Drive safe. I'll see you at home. - Yes, okay. Talk to you later.

00:28:52.575 --> 00:28:53.875
What am I going to do?

00:28:55.375 --> 00:28:57.945
How could they all do this to me?

00:29:00.815 --> 00:29:01.815
How...

00:29:24.375 --> 00:29:27.045
But wait, isn't this a completely unfair situation?

00:29:27.605 --> 00:29:30.475
Why should Driver Oh have to pay for the previous owner's mistake?

00:29:30.815 --> 00:29:34.485
Under current law, if a private taxi license holder gets a DUI,

00:29:34.615 --> 00:29:36.485
their license can be revoked.

00:29:37.215 --> 00:29:38.555
Looking at the circumstances,

00:29:39.085 --> 00:29:42.955
it seems the broker bought a license about to be revoked on the cheap...

00:29:43.125 --> 00:29:44.925
and then pawned it off on Driver Oh.

00:29:45.225 --> 00:29:46.695
That's fraud.

00:29:46.965 --> 00:29:50.565
- He can claim he didn't know. - What?

00:29:50.895 --> 00:29:53.865
The taxi's previous owner, the broker,

00:29:54.165 --> 00:29:56.275
the public official, the police.

00:29:57.205 --> 00:30:00.975
Driver Oh was caught in a blind spot between all of them.

00:30:01.505 --> 00:30:02.845
They knew about the loophole in the law...

00:30:04.015 --> 00:30:05.485
and exploited that blind spot.

00:30:06.045 --> 00:30:08.955
Still, Driver Oh fought desperately not to give up.

00:30:09.615 --> 00:30:12.555
Then why did he go all the way up to the rooftop?

00:30:14.385 --> 00:30:15.655
Because that wasn't the end of it.

00:30:20.195 --> 00:30:21.825
We're here, sir.

00:30:35.815 --> 00:30:37.175
Yes, this is your designated driver.

00:30:37.715 --> 00:30:41.415
Yes, I'm nearby. It'll take me about ten minutes.

00:30:41.485 --> 00:30:43.285
Okay, I'll be right there. Thank you.

00:30:44.785 --> 00:30:46.385
Excuse me, sir. The key...

00:30:53.965 --> 00:30:54.965
Thank you.

00:30:57.165 --> 00:31:00.935
- Yes, designated driver speaking. - Yes, this is Noblesse Motors.

I'm calling with the repair estimate for your luxury car.

00:31:08.445 --> 00:31:10.515
What are you talking about, calling me suddenly like this?

00:31:10.615 --> 00:31:13.685
The accident was minor, but it's a luxury car,

00:31:13.915 --> 00:31:15.955
so the estimate came out to 40,000 dollars.

00:31:16.955 --> 00:31:19.725
A luxury car? What on earth are you talking about?

00:31:20.025 --> 00:31:22.525
I've informed you. That is all.

00:32:03.295 --> 00:32:05.295

00:32:07.865 --> 00:32:09.175

00:32:13.375 --> 00:32:14.375
Cut it out!

00:32:14.845 --> 00:32:16.645

You took the 800 dollars we sent you every month.

00:32:38.465 --> 00:32:41.165
- But you said that was cashback... - Sir!

00:32:42.405 --> 00:32:45.805
That luxury car, with the title you signed over,

00:32:46.145 --> 00:32:48.475
got into a fender bender.

00:32:48.745 --> 00:32:52.345
Luckily, we got it fixed at a shop we know,

00:32:52.915 --> 00:32:56.055
so we managed to keep the cost down to 40,000 dollars.

You only showed me the very last page!

00:40:16.395 --> 00:40:17.995
(The Champion of the Used Car Market, Why? It's "Noblesse"!)

00:40:18.055 --> 00:40:21.965
They handle all auto brokering. Used car sales are their main thing.

00:40:22.225 --> 00:40:23.595
What's their capital structure like?

00:40:23.935 --> 00:40:27.235
The dealership building is fully mortgaged,

00:40:27.435 --> 00:40:30.505
and their cars are tied up in financing from a capital firm.

00:40:30.735 --> 00:40:34.005
So they're running a huge dealership with none of their own money.

00:40:34.505 --> 00:40:37.315
If things go south, they don't stand to lose a thing.

00:40:37.575 --> 00:40:39.145
Smart guy.

00:40:39.515 --> 00:40:41.815
Too bad he doesn't use that brain for something good.

00:40:42.145 --> 00:40:43.385
You're heading to the dealership first, right?

00:40:43.915 --> 00:40:44.915
That's the plan.

00:40:45.255 --> 00:40:48.955
Then I'll look for the foreign car registered in Driver Oh's name.

00:40:49.325 --> 00:40:50.325
Okay.

00:40:50.995 --> 00:40:55.765
Noblesse Motors.

00:40:56.435 --> 00:40:57.435
Noblesse?

00:41:00.605 --> 00:41:01.605
Noblesse.

00:41:02.535 --> 00:41:03.535
What?

00:41:04.005 --> 00:41:06.845
Nothing. Let's just go, for now.

00:41:20.025 --> 00:41:24.755
(Noblesse)

00:41:24.925 --> 00:41:27.965
(Deluxe Taxi)

00:41:28.395 --> 00:41:32.495
You know, that "Noblesse" sign looks really familiar.

00:41:33.005 --> 00:41:34.365
Now that you mention it,

00:41:35.005 --> 00:41:39.305
it does feel strangely familiar to me too.

00:41:39.475 --> 00:41:41.905
It's almost nostalgic, isn't it?

00:41:42.205 --> 00:41:43.215
Yes, same here.

00:41:43.775 --> 00:41:45.215
And here I thought you two remembered something.

00:41:49.485 --> 00:41:51.015
(Noblesse Private Taxi and Delivery Service)

00:41:51.685 --> 00:41:52.685
What?

00:41:59.225 --> 00:42:01.465
I'll be right back after one last test drive.

00:42:01.825 --> 00:42:03.695
- Wait! - What's wrong?

00:42:03.935 --> 00:42:05.265
Come on. What is it?

00:42:05.535 --> 00:42:07.404
I got you now, you jerk.

00:42:07.405 --> 00:42:09.235
Hey, where are you off to all of a sudden?

00:42:09.905 --> 00:42:10.905
I was wondering the same thing.

00:42:12.105 --> 00:42:13.105
Chief Choi!

00:42:20.385 --> 00:42:21.985
What? What is it? What's going on?

00:42:22.045 --> 00:42:23.585
It's the car thief! The one who stole our car!

00:42:23.885 --> 00:42:26.885
- Wait! - Oh, no. What now, Driver Kim?

00:42:27.485 --> 00:42:28.555
I'm not sure.

00:42:28.825 --> 00:42:29.825
What should we do?

00:42:30.525 --> 00:42:31.525
Hey, you!

00:42:35.095 --> 00:42:36.135
Here to look at a car?

00:42:36.735 --> 00:42:37.735
You don't recognize me?

00:42:38.895 --> 00:42:40.505
I'm not sure. Who are you?

00:42:42.775 --> 00:42:43.775
Then what about this car?

00:42:44.005 --> 00:42:45.475
(72S 5493)

00:42:45.575 --> 00:42:46.705
Still don't recognize me?

00:42:59.925 --> 00:43:01.625
You're the one who sold your "memories."

00:43:01.885 --> 00:43:03.955
You said you were just taking it for a test spin,

00:43:04.695 --> 00:43:05.955
and then you just took off.

00:43:07.525 --> 00:43:08.525
Pay me the rest.

00:43:09.535 --> 00:43:10.965
Either that, or give me the car!

00:43:11.895 --> 00:43:14.765
- What money? - Listen to this guy.

00:43:15.205 --> 00:43:16.375
So you're going to play dumb?

00:43:16.505 --> 00:43:20.775
I acquired the car per the contract. Why would I play dumb?

00:43:20.905 --> 00:43:22.775
What? According to the contract?

00:43:22.915 --> 00:43:26.745
It broke down during the test drive. Turns out the engine was shot.

00:43:26.915 --> 00:43:28.184
The repair estimate was 10,000 dollars,

00:43:28.185 --> 00:43:30.215
so I deducted that per the contract.

00:43:30.285 --> 00:43:32.785
- That's a lie! - Do you have any proof?

00:43:33.285 --> 00:43:35.485
I'm the proof, you jerk. I inspected it myself!

00:43:35.555 --> 00:43:38.455
What is your problem? Seriously, give it a rest.

00:43:38.825 --> 00:43:39.895
What's all this commotion?

00:43:41.095 --> 00:43:43.595
He just showed up out of nowhere and is making a scene over money.

00:43:43.665 --> 00:43:46.535
Look who's talking! You've got some nerve blaming me.

00:43:46.905 --> 00:43:49.165
Choi! Get this guy out of here.

00:43:49.505 --> 00:43:50.705
What do you mean, Choi... Hey...

00:43:51.675 --> 00:43:54.005
What? Gosh.

00:43:54.505 --> 00:43:56.745
Hey! Let go!

00:43:56.915 --> 00:43:59.945
Hey, you! Is your last name Choi? Which Choi clan are you from?

00:44:00.015 --> 00:44:02.585
- I'm a Choi too! - What's going on?

00:44:05.015 --> 00:44:07.085
Gosh! Oh, dear.

00:44:17.765 --> 00:44:19.065
You went in there ready to tear the place down.

00:44:20.205 --> 00:44:22.875
I almost got into some real trouble. Gosh, my back.

00:44:23.775 --> 00:44:26.205
Gosh, I've never met a Choi who was that violent.

00:44:26.605 --> 00:44:28.205
He's like one of the Choi clan of the Silla Dynasty.

00:44:47.295 --> 00:44:49.695
I found where the luxury car registered to Driver Oh is.

00:44:51.065 --> 00:44:53.365
- Where is it? - It's not far from here.

00:44:53.905 --> 00:44:55.065
Should we head there first?

00:44:55.535 --> 00:44:57.935
Wait, this car hit someone.

00:45:06.885 --> 00:45:07.885
Goodness.

00:45:08.715 --> 00:45:11.185
Do you know how much it costs to rent a luxury car for a month?

00:45:11.955 --> 00:45:15.785
- Three grand. - It's a luxury car. Four grand.

00:45:16.025 --> 00:45:17.855
It's 15,000 dollars.

00:45:18.555 --> 00:45:22.725
- How much? It's 15,000 dollars? - If that's for a legitimate rental,

00:45:23.295 --> 00:45:25.635
then they must be charging much more for that luxury car.

00:45:26.465 --> 00:45:29.435
- Why? - If it's in Driver Oh's name,

00:45:30.035 --> 00:45:33.445
then it's pretty obvious what kind of clients they have.

00:45:33.775 --> 00:45:34.775
And what kind is that?

00:45:35.245 --> 00:45:37.415
People who can't rent a car under their own name.

00:45:38.215 --> 00:45:41.945
Either they're already criminals, or they're about to become one.

00:45:42.715 --> 00:45:43.715
It's one or the other.

00:45:43.855 --> 00:45:46.725
Shouldn't we get Driver Oh out of that contract before it's late?

00:45:46.925 --> 00:45:48.685
Let's go, gorgeous.

00:45:54.495 --> 00:45:56.195
First things first. We need to get that car back.

00:45:58.265 --> 00:45:59.465
(Car-Free Street: 10am to 6pm)

00:46:00.165 --> 00:46:01.535
So many cars!

00:46:04.135 --> 00:46:08.675
- Where to? Straight ahead? - Yes! Let's roll!

00:46:10.015 --> 00:46:13.945
Ring, ring. Coming through.

00:46:14.015 --> 00:46:17.085
Hey, don't chicken out. We didn't hit them. Floor it!

00:46:17.155 --> 00:46:18.155
Get out of the way!

00:46:18.455 --> 00:46:23.025
Ring, ring. Got some nerve?

00:46:23.425 --> 00:46:27.825
- Watch out for that guy up ahead. - What on earth?

00:46:27.895 --> 00:46:28.895
Ring!

00:46:30.295 --> 00:46:31.295
What was that?

00:46:31.635 --> 00:46:33.704
- That jerk. Why isn't he moving? - What?

00:46:33.705 --> 00:46:34.765
Let's go!

00:46:36.435 --> 00:46:38.475
Are you okay? Should we get out of the way?

00:46:38.535 --> 00:46:40.975
They'll go around us. Those jerks.

00:46:45.015 --> 00:46:46.645
- Oh, no. - Are you okay?

00:46:49.615 --> 00:46:52.315
How could you hit him for real? Just chill. I'll handle this.

00:46:52.455 --> 00:46:53.455
Hey, you crazy jerk!

00:46:53.525 --> 00:46:56.525
My neck. It's completely shattered.

00:46:56.595 --> 00:46:58.255
Gosh, what are we going to do about this?

00:47:00.665 --> 00:47:02.025
You scratched my car.

00:47:02.725 --> 00:47:04.465
You rich, kid?

00:47:04.835 --> 00:47:06.865
This paint job alone costs 10,000 dollars.

00:47:07.865 --> 00:47:10.275
- Let's just go. - I asked if you're rich, you punk!

00:47:14.305 --> 00:47:15.305
I'm sorry.

00:47:15.905 --> 00:47:17.115
What are you looking at, jerks?

00:47:17.515 --> 00:47:19.475
- Goodness. - Go away!

00:47:19.985 --> 00:47:21.345
All right!

00:47:22.615 --> 00:47:23.615
They're insane!

00:47:31.825 --> 00:47:34.865
That's right. We've got to obey the light.

00:47:36.195 --> 00:47:39.135
Gosh, darn. This place is a madhouse.

00:47:39.495 --> 00:47:43.205
Hey, old lady! What, are you deaf?

00:47:43.775 --> 00:47:45.675
I said move to the side!

00:47:45.975 --> 00:47:50.245
- Dude, she can't hear you. - Hey, lady! Pick up the pace!

00:47:50.545 --> 00:47:51.545
Here's a gift!

00:47:52.215 --> 00:47:53.545
Are you kidding me right now?

00:47:54.185 --> 00:47:55.645
Drive safe.

00:47:59.155 --> 00:48:01.325
- Darn it! - Hey! What was that?

00:48:01.825 --> 00:48:03.795
Hold on. Hey, you!

00:48:03.855 --> 00:48:05.655
Hold up. Just a moment. You, there. Hold it.

00:48:05.725 --> 00:48:08.795
- What are you doing? - Hey, cabbie, move your car.

00:48:09.595 --> 00:48:10.995
Move your car, cabbie.

00:48:13.405 --> 00:48:14.905
You think you can just park here?

00:48:15.865 --> 00:48:16.935
You must be a real busy guy.

00:48:17.575 --> 00:48:18.575
Right?

00:48:19.035 --> 00:48:22.375
Hey, you dropped this. Is it yours? Now, you jerk.

00:48:25.445 --> 00:48:27.785
This is fun! Yes, real fun.

00:48:28.115 --> 00:48:30.785
All right. Time for Gear Second.

00:48:30.885 --> 00:48:32.655
Let's see you block this, you jerk.

00:48:33.455 --> 00:48:34.455
You jerk!

00:48:38.625 --> 00:48:41.125
This is a blast! This is so much fun.

00:48:41.495 --> 00:48:43.635
Where are you going?

00:48:43.695 --> 00:48:46.805
- Trying to run? Give it a shot. - Hey, what on earth?

00:48:47.565 --> 00:48:49.165
What in the world is this?

00:48:54.905 --> 00:48:55.905
Darn it.

00:48:57.615 --> 00:48:59.315
Got you, you little jerks.

00:48:59.645 --> 00:49:01.685
(Dings and Dongs Auto Restoration)

00:49:03.615 --> 00:49:05.015
Get out of here, you jerk!

00:49:06.385 --> 00:49:08.425
Darn, he thinks he's hot stuff.

00:49:09.625 --> 00:49:12.755
He doesn't know who he's up against.

00:49:22.405 --> 00:49:26.175
So these aren't just for show. You actually plan on killing them.

00:49:26.375 --> 00:49:27.575
What, you think we came to save you?

00:49:28.145 --> 00:49:29.675
It's too late to run, you jerk.

00:49:34.085 --> 00:49:36.345
- I was thinking the same thing. - Then die, you jerk!

00:49:50.035 --> 00:49:51.895
He's really going for the calf kicks.

00:49:52.795 --> 00:49:53.905
Stay back.

00:49:53.935 --> 00:49:54.965
Stay back, you jerk!

00:50:07.515 --> 00:50:08.515
Good grief.

00:50:14.655 --> 00:50:16.425
Let's go clean this up.

00:50:23.335 --> 00:50:25.065
(Vehicle Registration, Auto Lease, Used Car Financial Lease)

00:50:25.135 --> 00:50:26.965
(Client: Oh Man Soo)

00:50:27.035 --> 00:50:28.035
(Void without QR Code, Contract number)

00:50:30.875 --> 00:50:32.775
(Acquisition cost: 617,000 dollars)

00:50:40.445 --> 00:50:42.045
Good. It doesn't seem to have any other damage.

00:50:42.145 --> 00:50:43.815
Let's take it back and cancel the lease, then.

00:50:44.555 --> 00:50:46.385
Okay, got it.

00:50:47.525 --> 00:50:48.725
Apparently, we can't terminate the contract.

00:50:49.325 --> 00:50:50.325
What?

00:50:50.825 --> 00:50:53.725
So, the car is currently leased under Driver Oh's name,

00:50:53.795 --> 00:50:56.365
- they won't let us cancel early. - What if we can't cancel?

00:50:56.395 --> 00:50:58.365
We either have to transfer the lease to someone else,

00:50:58.435 --> 00:51:00.805
or we're stuck with it until the lease is up.

00:51:01.165 --> 00:51:02.505
Are there any other options?

00:51:03.065 --> 00:51:04.075
No.

00:51:04.705 --> 00:51:08.105
What? So we got the car back, but we still have to pay for it?

00:51:10.315 --> 00:51:13.385
Then we'll just have to get more money out of those guys.

Go Eun.

00:51:16.955 --> 00:51:18.455
I need you to pick out a car for me.

00:51:18.915 --> 00:51:19.925
A car?

00:51:20.855 --> 00:51:24.595
We got Driver Oh's car back, so now I'll buy a car we need.

00:51:24.825 --> 00:51:25.955
You're buying a car?

Hello.

Hello.

00:51:51.985 --> 00:51:54.325
Is there a particular model...

00:51:55.385 --> 00:51:57.994
- you're looking for? - This is my first car,

00:51:57.995 --> 00:52:00.495
so I'm not sure what to look for.

00:52:01.465 --> 00:52:04.635
I'm just looking for something that's as sturdy and safe as can be.

Yes, for my wife's hospital visits.
