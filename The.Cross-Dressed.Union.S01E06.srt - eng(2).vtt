00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.120
You can't be...

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.600
the Eldest Young Master Rui, right?

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.880
Why do you sound

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.080
a bit dismissive?

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.120
Everyone knows the Eldest Young Master Rui
is good-for-nothing.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.520
And

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.840
he's already married.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.240
I'm not the Eldest Young Master Rui.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.000
I'm the even less favored Second Young Master Rui.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.320
Second Young Master Rui?

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.320
Never heard of you.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.800
Second Young Master, wait for me!

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.320
This is your Green Pine Courtyard.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.400
Green Pine Courtyard...

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.160
I saw

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.800
they planted a pine tree here,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.680
so that's how it got its name.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.040
If you don't like it,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.120
you can change it anytime.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.000
I like it very much.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.640
Can you hurry up?

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.360
Second Young Master! Second Young Master!

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.000
Why are you walking so slowly, little maid?

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.720
Let me tell you,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.440
you can't even keep up with the princess's carriage in the palace.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.760
My legs aren't as long as yours.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.680
I can't walk fast.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.280
Yu'er.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.880
Guess what,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.960
this little girl

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.040
was sent by whom?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Princess Chunxi! Princess Chunxi!

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.080
How did you know?

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.680
Well...

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.320
Princess Chunxi

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.160
just snuck away from me.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.840
Weren't you having fun sneaking off?

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.320
How could a princess sneak away?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.200
I am generous.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.400
I forgive you.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.160
Thank you, Princess.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.240
Your Highness.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.000
You snuck out of the palace, didn't you?

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.080
I did.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.800
But...

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.920
Your Highness, please return quickly.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.960
If the Queen Mother and Your Majesty find out,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.920
they'll worry again.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.080
But I haven't finished...

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.480
I request the Princess to return to the palace.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.440
Our family

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.240
has two carriages, right?

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.520
How do we split them? It's not proper.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.600
No, don't!

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.240
Princess, please don't!

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.880
I'll strangle you!

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.520
Princess!

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.800
Princess, please don't!

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.000
That's true.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.040
Are you feeling better?

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.600
It's so hot.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.840
Prime Minister Ming's daughter,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.560
Ming Wanwan.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.680
Twenty-one years old.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.040
Ming Wanwan presents herself.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.600
Miss Ming enters the palace daily.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.680
No need to see her again, right?

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.400
Today is not like other days.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.000
Let Miss Ming present herself.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.640
Ming Wanwan presents herself.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.320
Your servant Ming Wanwan greets Your Majesty.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.040
Queen Mother.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.880
Rise.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.560
Sit.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.400
Thank you, Queen Mother.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.000
On my way here,

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.560
I saw the oleanders in your courtyard in full bloom.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.760
They're truly beautiful.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.680
I haven't left the palace lately.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.160
I haven't seen such a sight.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.040
Did Your Majesty see them on your way here?

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.400
Their graceful form and sturdy stems

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.960
are as lush as green shade and red blossoms.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.200
The oleanders in Mother's palace

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.440
are the best in the palace.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.040
May I be honored with a branch from the Queen Mother?

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.200
To take home and admire?

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.520
If you like,

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.480
someone will pick a branch for you.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.560
That's all.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.160
Thank you for your grace, Queen Mother.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.760
It's windy today.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.040
I heard Prime Minister Ming cough at court this morning.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.080
I'll have the imperial physician prepare some medicine.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.760
Take it back for Prime Minister Ming.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.200
I thank Your Majesty on my father's behalf.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.120
Prime Minister Ming works tirelessly for state affairs.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.880
It's just a prescription.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.040
No need for formalities.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.200
Go ahead.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.920
I take my leave.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.920
Your Majesty.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.000
The Ministry of Revenue has memorials

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.320
that need your approval today.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.240
If that's the case,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.080
state affairs come first.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.960
But...

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.440
The nation cannot go a day without an empress.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.480
Do you understand, Your Majesty?

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.880
I understand, Mother.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.080
Wanwan grew up with you.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.880
She is gentle and virtuous.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.200
You've met so many court ladies.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.560
Your Majesty,

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.120
what are your thoughts?

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.040
I'll follow Mother's arrangements.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.920
I take my leave.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.040
Go ahead.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.320
Your Majesty.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.400
There are countless beautiful sights in the palace.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.720
But in the end, they're trapped in this small world.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.600
If they cross the palace walls,

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.840
their branches will be cut off.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.320
No freedom.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:56.880
As long as they bloom,

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.040
they will be seen.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.000
Anywhere, they become a beautiful sight.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.480
As long as the right person sees them,

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.560
that's their best home.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.120
If Your Majesty doesn't wish to see me,

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.360
I'll only serve in the Queen Mother's palace.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.720
I won't trouble Your Majesty.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.400
I...

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.680
That's not what I meant.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.400
I have other matters.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.840
Stay and talk with the Queen Mother before you leave.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.640
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.200
Rui Yu, I'm sorry.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.680
Sorry for causing you trouble.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.000
Princess, you should go inside quickly.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.640
May I send an apology gift to your residence?

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.720
No need.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.840
Earlier,

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.840
I offended Madam Rui.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.880
Please don't take it to heart.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.280
They aren't upset.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.640
A few days ago,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.000
they even said they'd invite the Princess to the housewarming banquet.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.120
Really?

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.080
Of course.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.720
Then be sure to tell me the date of the banquet.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.520
Alright.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:10.760
Hurry back.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:11.880
Rui Yu.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.760
I'm leaving, then.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.360
When did we say

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.760
we'd hold a housewarming banquet?

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.440
Just teasing the kid.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:22.920
Let's go.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.160
Your second brother

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.800
lies without even blinking.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.360
He's always been like that.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.800
But

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.480
this housewarming banquet

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.560
is actually a good idea.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.280
A tranquil, elegant home.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.320
Free and at ease.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.280
Junior Sister.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.160
Miss Qiao.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:58.720
Junior Sister.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.240
My father wants to take me matchmaking again.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.280
Junior Sister, please save me!

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:04.680
Mas—

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.200
Who are you?

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:16.800
I...

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.640
Who are you looking for?

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.880
I'm looking for Rui Yu.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.920
They don't seem to be home.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:22.880
I see.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.240
Then...

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.680
You are...?

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.960
I'm a relative of the Rui family.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.480
Qiao Youyi.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.200
Qiao Youyi.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:29.720
Darn it.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.640
My father is chasing after me.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.080
Don't tell anyone you saw me.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:32.760
Keep it secret.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:33.680
Or I'll beat you up.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:42.680
Today

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.320
is our housewarming banquet.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.000
We've thought it over carefully.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.320
Our two families

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.960
haven't had a chance to meet.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.760
So we thought

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.080
to hold this banquet

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.520
and invite all our elders

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.800
for a small gathering.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.840
Dear in-law,

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.280
I've long admired your reputation.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.880
But never visited your home.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.640
Forgive me, forgive me.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.840
Your fame spreads far and wide.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:23.920
Today

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.480
to finally meet you

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.200
is a great honor.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:28.960
You're too kind.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.000
Cheers!

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.280
Everyone, let's drink.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.880
Come, come, let's drink!

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:35.920
These two are—

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.440
This is my master, General Qiao.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.200
And this is my senior, Qiao Youyi.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.040
Qiao Youyi.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.440
We must drink—come on!

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.120
I'll finish mine.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.480
You two, drink as you please.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.160
Junior Sister.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.840
You asked me and my father here—

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.920
It can't be just for the housewarming, right?

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.320
It's not just for the new house banquet.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.760
Next month

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.520
is my wife's birthday.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.080
I want to hold a birthday banquet for her.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.040
We'll invite officials then

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.200
so both civil and military officials can celebrate.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.040
Celebrate with the civil officials?

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.520
Isn't that a bit far-fetched?

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.120
Both big families are here.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.040
Why is that far-fetched?

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.400
That's not the same.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.160
We are

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.160
in-laws.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.360
What do we have to do with those civil officials?

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.320
I want to use this chance

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.280
to resolve civil-military discord.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.480
For the generals

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.720
to gain a place at court.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.080
To earn a seat.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.240
Decades of grudges

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.000
can't be solved by one banquet.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:39.440
Father,

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:40.880
I know.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.040
But if we do nothing,

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.240
these grudges

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.240
will last for decades, even centuries.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.680
Civil officials govern the nation.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.840
Military officials secure the land.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.080
Since ancient times,

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.800
civil and military must work together.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.600
Only then can the country thrive.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.320
We want to do this

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.600
to contribute to Ling An.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.080
To fit so many people here

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.880
then this garden for the banquet

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.320
really needs a thorough renovation

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:11.160
Eldest Brother

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.520
I'll provide the people, you do the work

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.240
for this job

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.320
let's split it thirty-seventy

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.440
Why split it thirty-seventy?

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.360
Are you treating this like business?

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.360
You want to ask Yu'er for money?

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.080
What kind of eldest brother are you?

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.400
Father, is that what I meant?

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.440
He wants a thirty-seventy split

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.720
I mean I'll do thirty percent of the work

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.800
and you do seventy percent

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.920
Why should I do seventy percent?

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.640
Because you're the eldest brother

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.960
The money for fixing the courtyard

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.160
I've already prepared it

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.320
I'll leave it to Eldest and Second Brother

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.080
It's no trouble at all

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.120
As the eldest brother

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:37.960
it's my duty

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.880
Good things are always born of thrift

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.200
Since ancient times, melons

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.000
are sweet after bitterness

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:46.960
No, no, no

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.760
Don't touch me

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.120
Everyone, slow down

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.160
Don't bump into anything

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:53.720
Alright, alright

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.680
Just put it here, that's fine

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.840
Put it down, put it down

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.520
Bring that stool over here for me

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.040
Careful, slow down

00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:58.680
Eldest Brother

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.320
Don't, Second Brother

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.600
Don't call me brother

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.240
You are my eldest brother

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:04.760
What did I do?

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:05.920
Just stand here

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.600
Give me a hand

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.960
Isn't Eldest Brother here?

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.560
I won't show off in front of the expert

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.120
I say

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.560
Eldest Young Master, Second Young Master, thank you

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.920
Why is he the one working hard?

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.200
Open your mouth, I'll feed you

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.880
Why are you so gross?

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:23.760
Pour it yourself

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.840
Day after day

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.120
You spilled it all over me

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.280
The dishes are ready

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:42.960
Put it down

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.000
People aren't here yet

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.800
I'll just have a taste

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.320
Come

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.000
What is it, really?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.080
You'll know when you come over

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.240
Look

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.720
These are medicinal dishes my senior and I developed

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:53.720
Try them

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.600
Tastes good

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.440
But the herbal flavor is a bit strong

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.720
Alright, got it

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.160
This dish is a bit sweet

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.480
This fish

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.200
I made it

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.640
It's delicious

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.080
Are all these meant to be eaten raw?

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.520
This is a southern specialty

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.600
Mushroom Hot Pot

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.320
My senior and I discussed it

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.640
We'll place a small pot on each table

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.800
with broth as the base

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.040
and assorted mushrooms

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.160
Cook and eat on the spot

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.840
It has a wild, earthy aroma

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.360
and is fresh and tasty

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.800
It's a unique flavor

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.400
Everyone, try it quickly

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.760
Since the head of the family said so

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:45.960
we can finally eat, right?

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.400
Eat, eat

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:54.760
Yu'er

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:55.960
Everyone's here

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:56.920
Good

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.080
Greetings, Sir

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.120
Madam, please take your seat

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.720
All the generals are here

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.000
Madam Rui is a general's daughter after all

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.000
We can't leave the generals out

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.560
Civil and military have been at odds for years

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.440
The generals have declined

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.960
Coming to a civil officials' banquet

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.600
won't feel uncomfortable, right?

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.400
Why worry so much?

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.320
Ladies and gentlemen

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:16.440
Sir Liu

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.320
Greetings, generals

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.000
Sir Rui

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.280
This

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.960
is the celebratory wine I prepared

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.440
It's osmanthus wine

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.080
Only five jars are made each month

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.240
I managed to get one jar just for you

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.080
How could I accept this?

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:40.880
Fine wine

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.160
should be shared

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.400
Why not open it at today's banquet

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.120
and uncork this wine

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.520
Ladies and gentlemen

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.440
Generals

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.800
Fine wine is rare

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.440
Let's all drink together

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.360
What do you think?

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.240
Good

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.520
Generals

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.400
We

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.680
shall drink this wine together

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.000
General Qiao

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.600
Sir Rui

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.440
Civil officials and scholars

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.400
serve in court with my son-in-law

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.080
In the future

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.360
please support my son-in-law

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.480
No need to say that

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.120
We rely on Sir Rui

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.240
Sir Rui is the rising star of the court

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.200
Except for his mentor, the Left Prime Minister

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.440
all the ministers in court

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.520
want to get closer to Sir Rui

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.720
Prime Minister Ming is here

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.240
Prime Minister Ming has arrived

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.760
Prime Minister Ming, Prime Minister Ming

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.600
Please come inside, please

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:48.840
Prime Minister Ming

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:50.760
Sir Rui

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.200
Last time you moved to a new home

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.160
I couldn't send a gift to congratulate you

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.520
Please forgive me

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.920
Prime Minister Ming, you're too polite

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.200
Please take your seat

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:01.720
Prime Minister Ming

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.240
Prime Minister Ming, Prime Minister Ming

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.440
Ladies and gentlemen

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.440
Let us drink this cup together

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:38.960
Your Majesty

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.480
Today is your wedding banquet

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.720
No need for formalities

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:49.960
Your Majesty

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.160
Is the food not to Your Majesty's taste?

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.560
At this banquet,

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.600
everyone has their own agenda.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.160
It's truly fascinating.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:03.440
Please, please.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.560
Come, come.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:06.520
Miss

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:08.760
Prince Pan is here.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.840
Why is he here?

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.040
The dishes will be served soon.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.160
Have Qiao Youyi

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.360
go keep an eye on the kitchen.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.600
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.320
Alright.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.400
Yu'er

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:35.720
Princess

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.040
Second Brother is being ridiculous.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.280
I will send someone to escort Princess Chunxi back to the palace.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.680
We mustn't let the Queen Mother worry.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.760
It's not his fault.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.120
I asked him to help me.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.960
I just have something I want to ask you.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.280
Yu'er, please answer me honestly.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.600
Princess, please speak your mind.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:53.880
You

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.120
do you truly love Miss Nan Chenxiao?

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.440
I just wanted to ask.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.040
Just wanted to know

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.800
Yu'er's true feelings.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.320
You're such a silly girl.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.840
Forgive my dullness.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:11.760
Before,

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.320
I only knew to serve the Emperor.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.640
Doing all I could.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:15.960
Serving the country and its people.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.320
Later, Your Majesty granted me a marriage.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:19.920
At first,

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.880
I worried she might be wronged.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.520
I only knew

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.720
to fulfill my duty as a husband.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:26.960
But now,

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.600
my feelings for Nan Chenxiao are sincere.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:33.920
Sorry, Prince Pan.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.400
This way, please.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.480
Madam Rui and Lord Rui

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.760
are truly a loving couple.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.760
Prince Pan, you flatter us.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.480
I understand, Yu'er.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.000
Thank you.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:51.520
Your Highness

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.440
I have matters to attend to in the front hall.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.640
I won't disturb you further.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.680
I'll visit you again when I get the chance.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.280
I...

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.240
Rui Wang

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:08.680
Come out.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.080
You caused this mess.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.400
Go and fix it right now.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.120
Second Brother is helping you.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.520
Why aren't things settled yet?

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.040
You...

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.840
Alright, alright, I'm going!

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:26.800
Don't follow me.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.080
Don't follow me.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.400
Why is it you?

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.400
Princess

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:38.760
Are you alright?

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.120
It's none of your business. Leave me alone.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:43.600
Why is that?

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.640
Move aside.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.240
How long are you going to follow me?

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.280
Until Princess Chunxi

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.640
is willing to return.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.200
What if I don't go back?

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.440
Then we'll just

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.760
keep walking together.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.760
Or

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.920
I can take you to the night market.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.360
Really?

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.040
Really.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.440
Then wait for me!

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.400
Hurry and catch up.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.240
Thank you, Madam Rui, for showing the way.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.480
I'll find a seat myself.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.320
No need to trouble Madam Rui.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.200
There are many guests at the banquet.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.800
If there is any lack in hospitality,

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.000
please forgive us, Prince Pan.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.680
I'm the one who came uninvited.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.280
Here, Madam.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:44.800
Eat.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:45.800
This one's cooked.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.760
Prince Pan! Prince Pan!

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.320
Everyone,

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.400
please be seated.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:51.920
Prince Pan

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.160
I offer you a toast.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.920
I didn't expect the Hanlin Academy officials

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.600
to be such heavy drinkers.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.360
Civil officials

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.120
always enjoy a few drinks.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.920
And write a few poems to express longing.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:05.880
Well,

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.400
after drinking, you get drunk.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.120
Over time,

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.520
you build up a tolerance.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.520
Scholars always speak so flowery.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:15.400
Come, cheers!

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.120
Hearing Lord Liu say that,

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:21.880
well,

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.800
it changes my impression of the Hanlin Academy.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.560
I'm just getting by.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.960
Getting into the Hanlin Academy

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.560
was pure luck.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.520
I toast to you.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:41.840
Princess

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.160
Are you alright?

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:44.480
I'm fine.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:45.800
Rui Wang is following.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.920
Prince Pan is here too.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:50.720
Yes.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.440
He's probably here to cause trouble.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.880
I've got Qiao Youyi watching the kitchen.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.480
I've stationed people everywhere.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.000
There won't be any problems.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:01.960
Thank you for your help.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.640
Here, Prince Pan.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.160
Prince Pan, Prince Pan.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.080
Please.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.000
Thank you all

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.800
for attending my wife's birthday banquet.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.280
My wife and I were just recently married.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.400
We wish to thank Your Majesty for granting our marriage.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.560
Uniting civil and military

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:27.720
as one family.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:28.680
Everyone,

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.480
let's drink together.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.600
Wishing Your Majesty good health.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.760
Wishing Ling An prosperity.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.680
Wishing peace to all under heaven.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.560
Wishing Your Majesty good health.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.200
Wishing Ling An prosperity.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.920
Peace to all under heaven.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:54.680
Father

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.160
Didn't they tell you not to drink?

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.440
I'm happy today.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.400
Let's have a few more drinks.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.360
Brother Liu

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:00.240
Come on

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.400
Cheers

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.120
Stop drinking.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.120
You child

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:07.760
Prince

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.200
Prince

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.000
Come, get up first.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.520
Prince, are you feeling unwell?

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.680
The Prince was poisoned at Lord Rui's manor.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.240
You owe Qian Yuan an explanation.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.160
Don't worry.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.160
I will surely cure the Prince.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.800
The mushrooms weren't fully cooked.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:49.320
Liang Jin

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.120
Quick, make a bowl of antidote soup.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.160
Yes

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.160
Madam Rui just tried to approach the Prince.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.480
What was your intention?

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.440
I just wanted the Prince to rest in a side room.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.880
He would feel better that way.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.400
I heard

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.160
today's banquet

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.920
was personally arranged by Madam Rui.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.920
Now the Prince is poisoned.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.520
If because of this

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.560
Qian Yuan is provoked

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.280
into war with Ling An, what about the Nan family

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.520
—how should they be punished?

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.000
Could it be you military officers

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.560
just want to start a war

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:32.720
and use this

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.240
to regain entry

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.480
to the court?

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.840
Nonsense!

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.680
Our Nan family would never harm the nation.

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.080
My lord, the antidote.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:43.960
Prince

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.160
Drink this first.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.680
Why are you so agitated?

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.880
Our Nan family has always been upright.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.600
How can we let you slander us?

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.320
My lords

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.360
Please calm down.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.160
Please be seated first.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.160
Please, don't be anxious.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.480
Come, come, have a seat first.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:59.800
Sit down, sit down.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.640
Prince, how do you feel now?

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.320
I'm sorry.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.200
Because of me

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.880
your banquet was disrupted.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.280
Everyone

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.320
I didn't cook the mushrooms properly.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.640
It has nothing to do with Lord Rui.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.520
As long as the Prince is fine.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.040
Mushrooms

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.400
are difficult to cook well.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:30.960
Madam Rui

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.080
let the guests cook the mushrooms themselves

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.200
—it's quite interesting.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.440
But I didn't know

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.560
my lords

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:38.800
and your families

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.080
are used to luxury.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.240
You've never done such things.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.520
Now

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.080
the Prince is poisoned.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.240
Everyone, be careful.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.240
Be sure

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.200
not to end up like the Prince.
