Ling Bo.

00:01:58.844 --> 00:02:00.124
What is this place?

00:02:02.685 --> 00:02:04.644
This compass doesn't seem reliable.

00:02:04.885 --> 00:02:07.165
Are you sure
the Soul Anchoring Lamp is here?

00:02:07.725 --> 00:02:08.845
That's what

00:02:08.845 --> 00:02:09.728
the manual says.

00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:11.804
It states within this ruined city.

00:02:11.924 --> 00:02:12.544
When we were

00:02:12.544 --> 00:02:13.364
outside just now,

00:02:13.364 --> 00:02:14.524
it pointed directly here.

00:02:14.605 --> 00:02:15.565
It should be right here.

00:02:16.325 --> 00:02:17.804
This place is enormous

00:02:17.952 --> 00:02:18.944
and dilapidated.

00:02:19.524 --> 00:02:20.684
There's not even a trace

00:02:20.684 --> 00:02:21.204
of the Lamp.

00:02:22.112 --> 00:02:22.764
Keep searching.

00:02:28.484 --> 00:02:29.084
Lin Hu,

00:02:29.285 --> 00:02:31.244
we are not going
to tear the place apart, are we?

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:32.885
Since the compass shows it's here,

00:02:32.964 --> 00:02:33.804
we'll tear it apart

00:02:33.804 --> 00:02:34.725
if we have to.

00:02:34.764 --> 00:02:36.005
Let's start tearing?

00:03:09.445 --> 00:03:10.176
Lin Hu,

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:11.804
what exactly does

00:03:11.845 --> 00:03:13.325
the Soul Anchoring Lamp look like?

00:03:13.764 --> 00:03:15.244
- Let's not miss it
- Well...

00:03:15.285 --> 00:03:16.005
without knowing.

00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:17.504
Young Master said

00:03:18.045 --> 00:03:19.244
this Soul Anchoring Lamp

00:03:19.244 --> 00:03:21.568
is a divine mountain-sealing artifact

00:03:21.696 --> 00:03:22.964
nurtured by heaven,

00:03:23.084 --> 00:03:24.576
and offered to the lord of this city.

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:26.244
So

00:03:26.684 --> 00:03:28.005
do you know

00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:29.725
its appearance or not?

00:03:30.804 --> 00:03:32.524
We'll know once we find it.

00:03:33.325 --> 00:03:35.040
So you don't actually know?

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.244
Then why are we searching?

00:03:36.244 --> 00:03:37.364
Not knowing isn't a crime.

00:03:37.364 --> 00:03:38.325
I'll know if I find it.

00:03:38.325 --> 00:03:39.165
Why are you mad?

00:03:52.405 --> 00:03:53.244
This must be it.

00:03:53.244 --> 00:03:54.405
Good thing we have a compass.

00:03:54.405 --> 00:03:55.605
Or we'd never have found you.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.484
Take a look.

00:03:58.644 --> 00:03:59.285
Wait.

00:04:00.445 --> 00:04:02.764
This spiritual tool draws power
from heaven and earth.

00:04:02.804 --> 00:04:03.804
Handle it cautiously.

00:04:07.804 --> 00:04:08.684
Oh, lamp.

00:04:09.005 --> 00:04:09.964
Divine lamp.

00:04:10.084 --> 00:04:12.285
We just need you to save lives.

00:04:12.484 --> 00:04:13.725
Nothing else.

00:04:14.112 --> 00:04:15.484
Please don't harm me.

00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:16.444
Smell it?

00:04:21.924 --> 00:04:23.004
Feel it.

00:04:23.045 --> 00:04:24.285
See if it has spiritual energy.

00:04:28.845 --> 00:04:29.525
How is it?

00:04:30.845 --> 00:04:31.564
Nothing at all.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.232
This doesn't look like a lamp to me.

00:04:37.124 --> 00:04:37.924
Lin Hu!

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:41.285
That painting!

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.484
Utmost tranquility, selfless void.

00:04:53.285 --> 00:04:54.085
Got it!

00:04:57.484 --> 00:04:58.324
Looks like this.

00:04:58.324 --> 00:04:59.364
Excellent.

00:05:02.845 --> 00:05:03.525
Excellent.

00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:05.725
Let go.

00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:07.045
No, I won't.

00:05:07.684 --> 00:05:09.605
Your young master is waiting.

00:05:12.725 --> 00:05:15.004
Yes, he's waiting.

00:05:43.884 --> 00:05:45.124
How can I expel

00:05:46.444 --> 00:05:48.160
the Gu parasite?

00:05:49.684 --> 00:05:50.605
Kong Hou.

00:05:51.205 --> 00:05:52.004
Zhong Xi.

00:05:52.725 --> 00:05:54.605
Why do you look so pale?

00:05:55.004 --> 00:05:55.725
Just now,

00:05:55.725 --> 00:05:57.564
were you trying to force
the Gu parasite out?

00:05:58.684 --> 00:05:59.484
Yes.

00:06:01.285 --> 00:06:03.744
But the dark cultivator's techniques
are too sinister.

00:06:04.045 --> 00:06:05.564
I've studied for days,

00:06:05.684 --> 00:06:06.564
yet remain unable

00:06:06.564 --> 00:06:07.965
to expel the Gu parasite.

00:06:08.484 --> 00:06:09.924
It's a pity that Xiao Pei

00:06:09.924 --> 00:06:10.845
stole ancient books

00:06:10.845 --> 00:06:11.804
from Jiusu,

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:13.504
but I barely glimpsed them

00:06:13.568 --> 00:06:14.784
before she had to return them.

00:06:15.004 --> 00:06:16.605
Given more time,

00:06:17.045 --> 00:06:18.684
I would surely find a solution

00:06:18.804 --> 00:06:20.244
from those books.

00:06:20.845 --> 00:06:22.124
If that's the case,

00:06:22.205 --> 00:06:23.872
I'll go back to Jiusu's lair again.

00:06:24.124 --> 00:06:25.564
I'll retrieve all those books

00:06:25.564 --> 00:06:26.444
for you.

00:06:26.525 --> 00:06:27.845
Wait here. I'm leaving now.

00:06:28.085 --> 00:06:28.765
Kong Hou.

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:31.168
Perhaps

00:06:31.168 --> 00:06:32.564
I should go with you?

00:06:32.645 --> 00:06:34.124
When I meet Jiusu,

00:06:34.165 --> 00:06:35.285
if it's just me,

00:06:35.285 --> 00:06:36.896
I could make excuses to him.

00:06:37.165 --> 00:06:38.004
I know

00:06:38.525 --> 00:06:40.124
my current condition

00:06:40.605 --> 00:06:42.016
will only cause you trouble.

00:06:42.684 --> 00:06:43.605
But

00:06:43.605 --> 00:06:45.045
if I make you steal the books,

00:06:45.124 --> 00:06:46.845
you'd take risks like Xiao Pei.

00:06:46.965 --> 00:06:48.285
Either way,

00:06:48.364 --> 00:06:49.924
it doubles the risk.

00:06:50.124 --> 00:06:52.096
If I can go there personally,

00:06:52.725 --> 00:06:54.405
it should be more effective

00:06:54.405 --> 00:06:56.244
than our current approach.

00:06:56.884 --> 00:06:58.144
You have a point.

00:06:59.004 --> 00:06:59.765
How about this?

00:06:59.965 --> 00:07:00.884
I've already

00:07:00.884 --> 00:07:01.884
informed Jiusu

00:07:01.884 --> 00:07:02.765
that I'm visiting

00:07:02.765 --> 00:07:04.128
Liuguang Sect these days.

00:07:04.405 --> 00:07:05.684
Before then,

00:07:05.765 --> 00:07:06.880
I'll find a way

00:07:07.165 --> 00:07:08.004
to bring you along

00:07:08.045 --> 00:07:08.896
to visit him once.

00:07:12.605 --> 00:07:13.364
Are you all right?

00:07:14.645 --> 00:07:15.285
This...

00:07:15.444 --> 00:07:16.965
Why did a barrier suddenly appear?

00:07:17.004 --> 00:07:17.605
Exactly!

00:07:17.605 --> 00:07:18.405
There wasn't one

00:07:18.405 --> 00:07:19.205
when we entered.

00:07:20.645 --> 00:07:21.605
I knew getting this lamp

00:07:21.664 --> 00:07:22.880
wouldn't be that easy.

00:07:23.244 --> 00:07:23.845
The lamp?

00:07:23.965 --> 00:07:25.124
Is the lamp intact?

00:07:27.564 --> 00:07:28.645
Well...

00:07:28.965 --> 00:07:30.004
Why is it gone?

00:07:30.645 --> 00:07:31.924
It was in my hand moments ago.

00:07:31.924 --> 00:07:33.085
I'm afraid we've been tricked

00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:34.124
by the lamp.

00:07:34.124 --> 00:07:36.045
Creating barriers and disappearing,

00:07:36.165 --> 00:07:37.845
it seems it doesn't want to leave.

00:07:38.004 --> 00:07:39.525
It has self-awareness?

00:07:40.512 --> 00:07:42.244
Didn't your young master say

00:07:42.324 --> 00:07:43.444
this Soul Anchoring Lamp

00:07:43.444 --> 00:07:44.725
is born divine mountain-sealing

00:07:44.725 --> 00:07:46.624
artifact nurtured by heaven?

00:07:46.924 --> 00:07:48.444
So it's not strange it's aware.

00:07:51.285 --> 00:07:52.045
Lamp!

00:07:52.804 --> 00:07:54.048
Divine lamp!

00:07:54.324 --> 00:07:56.285
We came seeking your help!

00:07:56.405 --> 00:07:57.484
As a spiritual tool,

00:07:57.484 --> 00:07:59.004
shouldn't you save lives

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:00.444
and uphold justice?

00:08:02.244 --> 00:08:04.416
Actually, spiritual tools
have no such obligations.

00:08:06.048 --> 00:08:07.104
Fair point.

00:08:07.845 --> 00:08:08.965
Then we should...

00:08:35.964 --> 00:08:36.724
Are you okay?

00:08:39.005 --> 00:08:39.964
Soul Anchoring Lamp,

00:08:40.084 --> 00:08:41.525
what do you really want?

00:08:43.165 --> 00:08:44.485
I was peacefully sleeping

00:08:44.485 --> 00:08:45.204
in my storybook.

00:08:45.204 --> 00:08:45.844
It speaks!

00:08:45.844 --> 00:08:47.564
You two disturbed my tranquility.

00:08:47.604 --> 00:08:48.604
How annoying!

00:08:48.604 --> 00:08:49.632
You can't leave!

00:08:49.924 --> 00:08:50.724
Divine lamp,

00:08:50.765 --> 00:08:52.804
we need your help to save lives.

00:08:52.964 --> 00:08:53.924
Why should I save lives?

00:08:53.924 --> 00:08:54.645
No way.

00:08:56.576 --> 00:08:57.204
What not?

00:08:57.204 --> 00:08:58.724
You're an ancient spiritual tool.

00:08:58.924 --> 00:08:59.924
The Ten Great Sects have

00:08:59.924 --> 00:09:01.405
many ancient spiritual tools too.

00:09:01.525 --> 00:09:02.844
When I tell them

00:09:03.045 --> 00:09:04.084
about your petty refusal

00:09:04.084 --> 00:09:05.645
to save dying lives,

00:09:05.724 --> 00:09:07.125
they'll mock you endlessly!

00:09:07.125 --> 00:09:08.416
Yes, endless mockery!

00:09:09.245 --> 00:09:10.844
I don't fear mockery!

00:09:11.005 --> 00:09:11.924
However,

00:09:11.924 --> 00:09:12.765
I've slept here

00:09:12.765 --> 00:09:13.724
for centuries.

00:09:13.765 --> 00:09:15.204
It is rather dull.

00:09:15.365 --> 00:09:16.245
Fine then.

00:09:16.245 --> 00:09:17.444
I'll give you one chance.

00:09:17.444 --> 00:09:18.005
One chance?

00:09:18.005 --> 00:09:18.604
If you

00:09:18.604 --> 00:09:19.765
can find me once,

00:09:19.765 --> 00:09:20.924
I'll go with you.

00:09:21.525 --> 00:09:22.485
Fine.

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:23.604
Promise sealed.

00:09:23.844 --> 00:09:25.245
Now hide properly!

00:09:46.604 --> 00:09:47.604
There's nothing...

00:09:55.285 --> 00:09:56.525
Soul Anchoring Lamp?

00:10:03.844 --> 00:10:04.684
You know.

00:10:05.365 --> 00:10:07.245
This room's small.

00:10:07.564 --> 00:10:08.765
What is Soul Anchoring Lamp's

00:10:08.765 --> 00:10:10.125
true form?

00:10:16.204 --> 00:10:17.405
It's the paperweight.

00:10:17.525 --> 00:10:18.684
There used to be

00:10:18.765 --> 00:10:20.045
a small piece of porcelain.

00:10:20.285 --> 00:10:21.485
Are you saying

00:10:21.684 --> 00:10:22.765
it's transformed?

00:10:23.405 --> 00:10:24.604
Then catch it.

00:10:26.165 --> 00:10:27.485
To tame it,

00:10:27.604 --> 00:10:28.844
mere capture won't suffice.

00:10:29.564 --> 00:10:30.365
What do we do?

00:10:32.005 --> 00:10:33.125
I've got an idea.

00:10:36.245 --> 00:10:38.084
Let's use our spiritual energy to infuse

00:10:38.125 --> 00:10:39.804
the paperweight with itchy liquid.

00:10:40.005 --> 00:10:42.005
Let's see how long it can endure.

00:10:42.125 --> 00:10:43.964
A drop won't be enough.

00:10:43.964 --> 00:10:45.724
We need at least a hundred times more.

00:10:45.765 --> 00:10:46.365
That way,

00:10:46.405 --> 00:10:48.245
it'll transform into an ugly monster!

00:11:02.005 --> 00:11:02.885
Stop!

00:11:02.924 --> 00:11:04.645
You two nuisances!

00:11:04.765 --> 00:11:07.005
Soul Anchoring Lamp,
we genuinely need you.

00:11:07.005 --> 00:11:08.285
If you return with us

00:11:08.285 --> 00:11:09.324
to save our friend,

00:11:09.365 --> 00:11:10.724
we'll reward you handsomely.

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:13.525
Name any condition you wish.

00:11:13.724 --> 00:11:14.604
Really?

00:11:14.645 --> 00:11:15.564
Yes.

00:11:15.684 --> 00:11:16.564
Then here's the deal.

00:11:16.645 --> 00:11:17.684
After everything's done,

00:11:17.724 --> 00:11:19.165
you two must bring me back here

00:11:19.204 --> 00:11:20.736
and play with me for 800 years.

00:11:20.844 --> 00:11:21.604
800 years?

00:11:23.444 --> 00:11:24.525
This...

00:11:24.924 --> 00:11:25.888
I agree.

00:11:26.245 --> 00:11:27.324
Me too.

00:11:27.405 --> 00:11:28.885
We can even form a spiritual pact!

00:11:41.645 --> 00:11:43.844
This little thing
is quite the trickster.

00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:45.645
Well...

00:11:47.724 --> 00:11:49.924
Do you truly plan

00:11:49.924 --> 00:11:51.604
to stay here with it for 800 years?

00:11:51.645 --> 00:11:53.204
That was just talk earlier.

00:11:53.324 --> 00:11:55.165
We need it to help us first.

00:11:56.485 --> 00:11:58.285
Ling Bo, thank you.

00:11:59.005 --> 00:12:00.885
No need. It's my duty.

00:12:01.005 --> 00:12:02.604
Anyway,

00:12:02.684 --> 00:12:03.844
after it's over,

00:12:03.844 --> 00:12:05.204
wherever

00:12:05.444 --> 00:12:06.324
you go,

00:12:06.444 --> 00:12:07.365
I'll go with you.

00:12:07.405 --> 00:12:09.056
Alright, let's go.

00:12:11.084 --> 00:12:11.765
Let's go.

00:12:12.928 --> 00:12:14.656
After delivering the lamp
to Young Master,

00:12:14.804 --> 00:12:16.844
we're already halfway there.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.844
By then,

00:12:17.844 --> 00:12:18.924
peace will reign.

00:12:19.005 --> 00:12:19.844
What?

00:12:19.924 --> 00:12:21.165
Only halfway?

00:12:21.165 --> 00:12:21.765
Yes.

00:12:22.084 --> 00:12:23.084
First,

00:12:23.084 --> 00:12:24.285
the lamp must actually work.

00:12:24.444 --> 00:12:25.285
If it can't suppress

00:12:25.285 --> 00:12:26.405
the dark cultivator blood

00:12:26.405 --> 00:12:27.724
within Kong Hou's body,

00:12:27.804 --> 00:12:29.204
this whole trip was pointless.

00:12:30.045 --> 00:12:31.684
What do you mean by "actually work"?

00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:32.645
If you don't trust me,

00:12:32.645 --> 00:12:33.568
don't ask for my help.

00:12:34.204 --> 00:12:35.564
It's not about trust.

00:12:35.564 --> 00:12:36.964
We'll only know if it works

00:12:36.964 --> 00:12:37.724
once you meet her

00:12:37.724 --> 00:12:39.285
and the illness is cured, right?

00:12:39.724 --> 00:12:40.684
You'll see!

00:12:42.765 --> 00:12:45.525
I truly hope our Liuguang Sect

00:12:46.165 --> 00:12:47.405
recruits more juniors.

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:50.084
After eliminating the dark cultivator,

00:12:50.204 --> 00:12:50.885
when Young Master

00:12:50.885 --> 00:12:51.844
leads the new disciples,

00:12:51.844 --> 00:12:53.245
I'll play with them every day.

00:12:53.724 --> 00:12:56.005
A simple wish.

00:12:56.165 --> 00:12:56.844
Wish?

00:12:57.125 --> 00:12:59.045
Speaking of wishes, I do have one.

00:12:59.072 --> 00:13:00.804
What is it? Can you share?

00:13:00.844 --> 00:13:01.765
It's...

00:13:03.724 --> 00:13:05.365
Spit it out or don't!

00:13:05.365 --> 00:13:07.125
Fine! I'll say it.

00:13:09.005 --> 00:13:10.604
My wish is

00:13:10.765 --> 00:13:13.216
to find a cultivation partner

00:13:13.525 --> 00:13:15.136
who shares my passions.

00:13:15.444 --> 00:13:17.344
And we'll raise children together

00:13:17.684 --> 00:13:18.724
and keep a dog.

00:13:18.924 --> 00:13:20.324
Whether we ascend

00:13:20.485 --> 00:13:21.792
or remain in Lingyou Realm,

00:13:22.245 --> 00:13:23.072
we'll

00:13:23.365 --> 00:13:24.964
live blissfully like immortals.

00:13:27.045 --> 00:13:29.165
The fox wants a wife!

00:13:29.285 --> 00:13:31.645
Too bad. No one wants a stinky fox.

00:13:32.324 --> 00:13:33.765
Y-You foolish lamp!

00:13:33.885 --> 00:13:35.165
Oh, I get it!

00:13:35.365 --> 00:13:36.724
You want Ling Bo

00:13:36.724 --> 00:13:38.285
to marry you.

00:13:39.084 --> 00:13:39.684
Silence!

00:13:40.005 --> 00:13:40.844
Nonsense!

00:13:41.765 --> 00:13:43.204
I-It's just talking nonsense.

00:13:45.245 --> 00:13:45.924
So you...

00:13:45.924 --> 00:13:47.405
Don't you think this idea of mine

00:13:47.405 --> 00:13:48.365
is perfect?

00:13:49.204 --> 00:13:50.045
That's all?

00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:50.924
That's it.

00:13:50.924 --> 00:13:51.684
Perfect?

00:13:51.844 --> 00:13:52.485
Not perfect?

00:13:52.604 --> 00:13:53.645
Cliché!

00:13:54.285 --> 00:13:55.324
A grown man

00:13:55.324 --> 00:13:56.005
spends all day

00:13:56.005 --> 00:13:57.324
obsessing over love.

00:13:57.405 --> 00:13:58.444
Wait. What do you mean

00:13:58.444 --> 00:13:59.844
"a grown man obsessing over love?"

00:14:00.045 --> 00:14:00.844
This is called

00:14:00.964 --> 00:14:02.844
f-fundamental human nature.

00:14:02.844 --> 00:14:04.125
Desires, okay?

00:14:04.125 --> 00:14:05.245
You said it yourself

00:14:05.245 --> 00:14:06.885
it's fundamental human nature.

00:14:06.885 --> 00:14:08.005
You stinky fox,

00:14:08.005 --> 00:14:09.645
dare crave love?

00:14:10.005 --> 00:14:11.125
Exactly!

00:14:11.872 --> 00:14:12.604
Silence!

00:14:15.924 --> 00:14:16.604
I admit

00:14:16.724 --> 00:14:17.604
I'm not human.

00:14:17.804 --> 00:14:19.604
But even as a fox,

00:14:19.604 --> 00:14:20.405
these feelings

00:14:20.405 --> 00:14:21.525
are perfectly normal, right?

00:14:21.684 --> 00:14:22.924
Well, you?

00:14:23.084 --> 00:14:25.885
What's your ideal version

00:14:25.885 --> 00:14:26.885
of a perfect life?

00:14:30.125 --> 00:14:31.525
As for me,

00:14:32.844 --> 00:14:34.645
I want to rightfully

00:14:34.645 --> 00:14:36.064
become the revered

00:14:36.192 --> 00:14:37.844
head of Zhaohan Sect.

00:14:39.136 --> 00:14:39.724
That's...

00:14:40.564 --> 00:14:41.280
T-That's all?

00:14:43.165 --> 00:14:44.005
Nothing else?

00:14:44.485 --> 00:14:45.804
Nothing more.

00:14:45.804 --> 00:14:46.365
Let's go.

00:14:46.365 --> 00:14:47.045
Truly nothing?

00:14:47.684 --> 00:14:48.324
Wait.

00:14:48.525 --> 00:14:50.405
Your ambition seems too basic.

00:14:51.165 --> 00:14:53.125
Stop. Stop!

00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:54.165
What's happening?

00:14:55.005 --> 00:14:55.924
It smells so good!

00:14:55.964 --> 00:14:56.804
I've been sealed

00:14:56.804 --> 00:14:58.084
in that place for centuries.

00:14:58.204 --> 00:14:59.924
I haven't received offerings in ages.

00:14:59.964 --> 00:15:01.365
Buy me treats now,

00:15:01.444 --> 00:15:02.684
or I refuse to move.

00:15:02.844 --> 00:15:04.324
Our journey is urgent.

00:15:04.365 --> 00:15:06.324
After finishing our task,

00:15:06.324 --> 00:15:07.765
we'll buy you whatever you want.

00:15:07.765 --> 00:15:08.245
Deal?

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:10.405
No! I need to eat now!

00:15:10.405 --> 00:15:12.324
Or else, I'll...

00:15:12.405 --> 00:15:13.165
Immolate myself!

00:15:13.564 --> 00:15:14.365
Immolate yourself?

00:15:14.365 --> 00:15:15.645
Go ahead. Show me.

00:15:15.684 --> 00:15:16.645
Fine.

00:15:16.765 --> 00:15:18.045
Let it eat if it insists.

00:15:18.045 --> 00:15:18.964
Better than having

00:15:18.964 --> 00:15:19.964
it cause trouble later.

00:15:21.804 --> 00:15:22.604
Alright then.

00:15:22.885 --> 00:15:24.084
Eat!

00:15:24.724 --> 00:15:25.964
That's more like it.

00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:26.604
Let's go.

00:15:26.684 --> 00:15:27.324
Go.

00:15:45.125 --> 00:15:46.324
I've confirmed

00:15:46.365 --> 00:15:48.005
Jiusu will leave today on business,

00:15:48.005 --> 00:15:49.285
with Wu Bei accompanying him.

00:15:49.444 --> 00:15:50.645
We have ample time

00:15:50.645 --> 00:15:51.680
to search thoroughly.

00:16:27.204 --> 00:16:28.645
These books

00:16:29.045 --> 00:16:31.245
mainly record esoteric arts.

00:16:32.165 --> 00:16:34.604
We should find clues here.

00:16:52.724 --> 00:16:53.525
Let me handle it.

00:17:07.084 --> 00:17:08.364
I'm so scared.

00:17:09.564 --> 00:17:10.324
Since coming here

00:17:10.324 --> 00:17:11.725
with Jiusu,

00:17:12.324 --> 00:17:14.005
I've kept telling myself

00:17:14.445 --> 00:17:15.485
to stay strong.

00:17:16.245 --> 00:17:17.164
But

00:17:17.804 --> 00:17:19.884
I've done so many things
against my conscience.

00:17:20.084 --> 00:17:21.920
Will everyone hate me?

00:17:23.045 --> 00:17:24.084
After all this,

00:17:24.285 --> 00:17:26.045
will they ever forgive me?

00:17:27.045 --> 00:17:28.045
Yes.

00:17:29.644 --> 00:17:31.084
Everything you've done

00:17:31.084 --> 00:17:32.084
is for all living beings

00:17:32.084 --> 00:17:33.005
in the Lingyou Realm.

00:17:33.005 --> 00:17:33.920
I've witnessed it all.

00:17:35.245 --> 00:17:35.804
At that time,

00:17:35.804 --> 00:17:36.960
I'll testify for you.

00:17:37.245 --> 00:17:38.045
I believe those

00:17:38.045 --> 00:17:39.488
who survived because of you

00:17:39.844 --> 00:17:40.925
will all be grateful

00:17:41.564 --> 00:17:44.224
just like me.

00:17:44.844 --> 00:17:46.208
But this time,

00:17:46.884 --> 00:17:48.485
without any reason,

00:17:48.844 --> 00:17:50.848
I always feel uneasy.

00:17:52.285 --> 00:17:53.088
Zhong Xi,

00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:54.324
promise me.

00:17:54.925 --> 00:17:56.525
This time when I'm out,

00:17:56.844 --> 00:17:57.792
no matter what happens,

00:17:57.792 --> 00:17:59.445
you must protect yourself.

00:17:59.604 --> 00:18:00.765
Don't have any contact

00:18:00.765 --> 00:18:01.804
with Jiusu.

00:18:02.084 --> 00:18:02.765
You

00:18:03.485 --> 00:18:05.324
have to wait here for me to return.

00:18:05.404 --> 00:18:06.285
Understood.

00:18:08.564 --> 00:18:09.525
I promise you.

00:18:10.525 --> 00:18:11.765
It makes sense.

00:18:12.164 --> 00:18:13.344
You're juggling both sides,

00:18:13.472 --> 00:18:15.456
anxious

00:18:15.644 --> 00:18:16.884
and on edge

00:18:17.124 --> 00:18:18.528
the whole time.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.604
That's normal.

00:18:22.205 --> 00:18:23.364
I'll wait for you here.

00:18:27.005 --> 00:18:28.604
Let's search now.

00:18:29.005 --> 00:18:29.765
See

00:18:29.804 --> 00:18:30.685
if there's a way

00:18:30.685 --> 00:18:31.765
to remove the Gu parasites.

00:18:35.364 --> 00:18:37.285
You foolish lamp. You really eat a lot.

00:18:37.404 --> 00:18:39.205
You ordered even when you can't finish.

00:18:39.205 --> 00:18:39.844
Enjoyed it?

00:18:39.844 --> 00:18:40.485
Can't finish it?

00:18:40.485 --> 00:18:42.124
Isn't it nice just to smell it?

00:18:42.285 --> 00:18:43.205
If you obediently

00:18:43.205 --> 00:18:43.925
help me,

00:18:43.925 --> 00:18:44.804
we'll let smell many

00:18:44.804 --> 00:18:45.364
tasty foods.

00:18:45.364 --> 00:18:46.245
Stop. Stop.

00:18:46.285 --> 00:18:47.485
- What's wrong now?
- What's wrong?

00:18:47.564 --> 00:18:48.884
I want to see a beauty.

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:50.245
The street is deserted,

00:18:50.285 --> 00:18:51.324
not a single beauty.

00:18:51.604 --> 00:18:53.045
Stop messing around, okay?

00:18:53.124 --> 00:18:54.124
We're not out for fun.

00:18:54.124 --> 00:18:55.725
We're on an important
lifesaving mission.

00:18:55.725 --> 00:18:56.604
Exactly.

00:18:57.285 --> 00:18:57.925
What's wrong?

00:18:58.164 --> 00:18:59.445
It pricked me.

00:18:59.564 --> 00:19:00.084
I...

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:01.685
You fool lamp.

00:19:01.685 --> 00:19:02.644
What's wrong with you?

00:19:02.685 --> 00:19:03.485
If you joke again,

00:19:03.485 --> 00:19:04.525
I really won't be polite.

00:19:04.564 --> 00:19:06.364
- She hit me first!
- Forget it.

00:19:06.485 --> 00:19:08.084
Zhong Xi and Kong Hou are still waiting.

00:19:08.124 --> 00:19:08.804
We need to hurry.

00:19:08.884 --> 00:19:09.644
Behave yourself.

00:19:11.245 --> 00:19:12.205
Zhong Xi, look.

00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:15.164
Nine-Yin Corpse Gu.

00:19:15.525 --> 00:19:17.445
It's forged from a pure-yin corpse

00:19:17.445 --> 00:19:19.164
that perished in a place

00:19:19.164 --> 00:19:21.124
of utmost yin, thus the Gu is born.

00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:22.604
Once Nine-Yin Corpse Gu

00:19:22.644 --> 00:19:24.192
enters a living body,

00:19:24.485 --> 00:19:26.205
if not driven by spiritual energy,

00:19:26.685 --> 00:19:28.765
the person remains the same
as any other.

00:19:28.844 --> 00:19:30.285
But if the caster

00:19:30.324 --> 00:19:32.205
activates it with spiritual energy,

00:19:32.364 --> 00:19:35.124
it will cause severe pain
to the heart and insanity.

00:19:35.285 --> 00:19:37.804
Within half a day, they will bleed
from the orifices and die.

00:19:38.205 --> 00:19:40.445
This must be

00:19:40.564 --> 00:19:41.725
the Gu parasite Jiusu forged.

00:19:41.844 --> 00:19:43.404
Is there a way to break it?

00:19:43.485 --> 00:19:44.364
Let me see.

00:19:45.485 --> 00:19:46.245
Here it is.

00:19:48.765 --> 00:19:50.205
Take a container.

00:19:50.485 --> 00:19:52.205
Fill it with the blood

00:19:52.205 --> 00:19:53.445
of a pure individual,

00:19:56.124 --> 00:19:57.965
and then cut the palm

00:19:57.965 --> 00:19:59.164
of the afflicted person.

00:19:59.485 --> 00:20:00.925
Cast a spell,

00:20:01.124 --> 00:20:02.084
and the Gu parasite

00:20:02.084 --> 00:20:03.765
will be attracted to the fresh blood.

00:20:03.965 --> 00:20:05.685
Once it is immobilized,

00:20:05.884 --> 00:20:07.485
burn it with true fire.

00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:09.884
Zhong Xi,

00:20:10.124 --> 00:20:11.045
isn't this

00:20:11.045 --> 00:20:12.084
the solution?

00:20:12.205 --> 00:20:13.285
Let's try it now.

00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:15.844
But

00:20:15.844 --> 00:20:17.525
what does the book mean

00:20:17.564 --> 00:20:20.404
by the fresh blood

00:20:20.604 --> 00:20:21.725
of a pure individual?

00:20:25.485 --> 00:20:27.164
Well...

00:20:27.804 --> 00:20:29.632
Why are you blushing?

00:20:33.564 --> 00:20:34.324
By the way,

00:20:34.765 --> 00:20:36.725
I read in a storybook

00:20:36.965 --> 00:20:39.084
that a pure individual means

00:20:39.124 --> 00:20:40.364
someone who is not married.

00:20:42.445 --> 00:20:44.844
Where do we find a pure individual?

00:20:45.364 --> 00:20:45.884
How about

00:20:45.884 --> 00:20:47.205
we catch a dark cultivator later?

00:20:47.205 --> 00:20:48.084
What if the one we get

00:20:48.084 --> 00:20:49.408
is not a pure individual?

00:20:49.725 --> 00:20:51.604
Haven't we wasted our efforts then?

00:20:52.604 --> 00:20:53.925
Then maybe let me try?

00:20:54.364 --> 00:20:55.045
No, no!

00:20:56.245 --> 00:20:57.005
That's unnecessary.

00:20:57.205 --> 00:20:58.804
Why hesitate now?

00:20:58.804 --> 00:21:00.324
We haven't got married so far.

00:21:00.404 --> 00:21:02.285
Perhaps fate reserved us
for this moment.

00:21:02.285 --> 00:21:03.765
Jiusu will return soon.

00:21:03.884 --> 00:21:04.445
We must

00:21:04.445 --> 00:21:05.644
remove the Gu parasite

00:21:05.685 --> 00:21:07.084
before he comes back.

00:21:15.084 --> 00:21:17.005
You're truly something.

00:21:17.005 --> 00:21:19.445
Demanding food and drink all the way.

00:21:19.485 --> 00:21:20.644
Let me make this clear.

00:21:20.685 --> 00:21:21.685
We have no time

00:21:21.685 --> 00:21:22.525
for your games.

00:21:22.525 --> 00:21:23.872
We're on a tight schedule.

00:21:25.045 --> 00:21:26.765
I ate three bowls
of beef noodles earlier.

00:21:26.804 --> 00:21:27.725
Too salty.

00:21:27.725 --> 00:21:28.685
I want tea.

00:21:28.804 --> 00:21:30.364
You want tea?

00:21:32.965 --> 00:21:33.844
Ling Bo! Ling Bo!

00:21:34.604 --> 00:21:36.084
What now?

00:21:36.285 --> 00:21:37.804
I apologize.

00:21:37.804 --> 00:21:39.045
Don't be angry.

00:21:40.364 --> 00:21:41.005
Forget it.

00:21:41.205 --> 00:21:42.685
I won't stoop to your level.

00:21:43.104 --> 00:21:45.005
You're so kind.

00:21:47.245 --> 00:21:48.084
Lin Hu!

00:21:48.324 --> 00:21:49.124
What?

00:21:49.285 --> 00:21:51.324
What did you say you wanted to do

00:21:51.404 --> 00:21:52.965
once we took down dark cultivators?

00:21:54.048 --> 00:21:54.925
Ling Bo,

00:21:55.564 --> 00:21:57.485
I want to marry you immediately!

00:21:57.485 --> 00:21:58.804
Raise children together!

00:21:59.445 --> 00:22:01.084
Shameless!

00:22:01.164 --> 00:22:01.725
Wait.

00:22:02.364 --> 00:22:03.245
Who are you cursing?

00:22:04.084 --> 00:22:05.525
Ling Bo. Ling Bo.

00:22:06.164 --> 00:22:06.965
Ling Bo.

00:22:07.296 --> 00:22:08.084
Ling Bo.

00:22:08.404 --> 00:22:09.245
Ling Bo.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.884
Ling Bo, wait for me!

00:22:10.884 --> 00:22:12.704
You're done for. She's furious now.

00:22:16.564 --> 00:22:17.485
Kong Hou,

00:22:17.888 --> 00:22:19.328
is this truly necessary?

00:22:19.804 --> 00:22:21.285
It's just a small cut

00:22:21.285 --> 00:22:22.765
on my hand.

00:22:22.884 --> 00:22:23.765
Besides,

00:22:23.884 --> 00:22:25.364
this is all to save you.

00:22:25.765 --> 00:22:26.485
Okay.

00:22:36.685 --> 00:22:38.285
From wondrous unity springs life.

00:22:38.725 --> 00:22:40.192
To wondrous unity all things return.

00:22:41.804 --> 00:22:43.685
Divided into three origins,

00:22:43.884 --> 00:22:45.725
and then from three origins.

00:23:04.485 --> 00:23:05.324
Zhong Xi,

00:23:05.644 --> 00:23:06.604
hold on.

00:23:06.804 --> 00:23:07.404
The Gu parasite

00:23:07.404 --> 00:23:08.725
seems to be moving out.

00:23:08.725 --> 00:23:09.765
Don't worry about me.

00:23:10.124 --> 00:23:11.005
I'm fine.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.644
Put your hand in.

00:23:29.604 --> 00:23:31.725
The Gu parasite was squirming earlier,

00:23:31.925 --> 00:23:32.725
but now it seems

00:23:32.725 --> 00:23:33.804
to be completely gone.

00:23:33.965 --> 00:23:35.005
Zhong Xi,

00:23:35.324 --> 00:23:37.164
we actually removed the Gu parasite.

00:23:37.404 --> 00:23:38.240
It's great.

00:23:38.965 --> 00:23:40.324
How do you feel now?

00:23:42.005 --> 00:23:43.245
Let me try.

00:23:48.364 --> 00:23:49.205
Great.

00:23:49.485 --> 00:23:51.124
We finally succeeded.

00:23:52.804 --> 00:23:53.564
Ling Bo.

00:23:54.245 --> 00:23:54.965
Ling Bo.

00:23:55.324 --> 00:23:56.124
I understand now.

00:23:56.245 --> 00:23:57.445
Let me explain.

00:23:57.445 --> 00:23:58.525
You're under Reverse Spell,

00:23:58.525 --> 00:23:59.045
you know?

00:23:59.045 --> 00:23:59.925
How dare you!

00:23:59.925 --> 00:24:00.965
Spouting nonsense again!

00:24:00.965 --> 00:24:01.604
I'm not.

00:24:01.604 --> 00:24:03.124
I told you. It's the lamp!

00:24:03.245 --> 00:24:03.965
Oh, no.

00:24:03.965 --> 00:24:05.604
Everything I say sounds opposite to her.

00:24:05.765 --> 00:24:07.164
Break the spell now.

00:24:07.245 --> 00:24:07.844
Or I'll

00:24:07.844 --> 00:24:08.804
seal you underground.

00:24:08.844 --> 00:24:09.685
Still making excuses?

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.485
I'm not.

00:24:10.525 --> 00:24:11.364
Ling Bo, I'm not.

00:24:19.685 --> 00:24:20.285
Ling Bo.

00:24:21.205 --> 00:24:22.285
What's happening now?

00:24:22.604 --> 00:24:23.844
Why aren't you affected?

00:24:24.364 --> 00:24:25.124
I see.

00:24:25.164 --> 00:24:26.445
Because you're a fox.

00:24:26.445 --> 00:24:27.005
Ling Bo.

00:24:27.084 --> 00:24:28.245
Stop calling her.

00:24:28.285 --> 00:24:29.124
She can't hear you.

00:24:29.124 --> 00:24:30.080
I've sent her

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.296
into an illusion.

00:24:31.296 --> 00:24:31.776
An illusion?

00:24:31.776 --> 00:24:33.485
She's living an immortal life there.

00:24:33.485 --> 00:24:34.485
An immortal life?

00:24:36.925 --> 00:24:37.685
Ling Bo.

00:24:58.804 --> 00:25:01.285
This is the Yunhua Sect?

00:25:03.804 --> 00:25:04.925
Xiao Dong,

00:25:05.404 --> 00:25:06.685
why are you here?

00:25:06.804 --> 00:25:07.965
My love, you're awake.

00:25:08.205 --> 00:25:10.285
What did you call me?

00:25:10.564 --> 00:25:11.285
My love?'

00:25:13.604 --> 00:25:14.560
You're still groggy?

00:25:16.364 --> 00:25:17.604
What's going on here?

00:25:19.045 --> 00:25:20.285
You're truly still groggy.

00:25:20.804 --> 00:25:21.884
After years of marriage,

00:25:21.925 --> 00:25:23.045
you're still this cute.

00:25:23.164 --> 00:25:24.005
This post-sleep daze

00:25:24.045 --> 00:25:25.604
is just how you always are.

00:25:27.045 --> 00:25:28.285
Marriage?

00:25:29.245 --> 00:25:31.485
You and me?

00:25:32.804 --> 00:25:34.005
Who else would it be?

00:25:36.765 --> 00:25:37.364
Alright.

00:25:37.485 --> 00:25:38.364
Get ready.

00:25:38.485 --> 00:25:39.685
Later, we'll be attending

00:25:39.725 --> 00:25:40.965
Tan Feng's succession ceremony.

00:25:41.084 --> 00:25:41.965
Tan Feng?

00:25:43.245 --> 00:25:44.644
Succession ceremony?

00:25:45.765 --> 00:25:47.285
What kind of situation is this?

00:25:47.844 --> 00:25:49.364
What's wrong? A headache?

00:25:49.445 --> 00:25:51.324
I feel like I've forgotten something.

00:25:51.485 --> 00:25:53.205
Did you forget to bring something?

00:25:54.324 --> 00:25:55.045
No.

00:25:56.045 --> 00:25:58.912
I remember Kong Hou and Zhong Xi.

00:25:59.205 --> 00:26:00.485
Oh, yes, and Jiusu too.

00:26:00.525 --> 00:26:01.364
What about them?

00:26:01.485 --> 00:26:02.604
Why would it be Tan Feng

00:26:02.644 --> 00:26:03.776
succeeding as the Head?

00:26:05.404 --> 00:26:07.232
My love, you've truly
been confused by sleep.

00:26:07.564 --> 00:26:09.445
These events happened centuries ago.

00:26:09.884 --> 00:26:11.040
Centuries?

00:26:13.644 --> 00:26:14.564
Back then,

00:26:15.124 --> 00:26:15.884
you and I found

00:26:15.884 --> 00:26:17.005
the Soul Anchoring Lamp,

00:26:17.124 --> 00:26:17.965
suppress Kong Hou's

00:26:17.965 --> 00:26:18.944
dark cultivator blood.

00:26:19.245 --> 00:26:20.448
Master Zhong Xi and Kong Hou

00:26:20.448 --> 00:26:21.925
eradicated the Dark Cultivator Hall

00:26:22.045 --> 00:26:23.205
and defeated Jiusu.

00:26:23.765 --> 00:26:24.445
And now,

00:26:24.485 --> 00:26:25.124
the two of them

00:26:25.124 --> 00:26:26.272
have ascended for years.

00:26:26.685 --> 00:26:27.840
Is that truly how it was?

00:26:31.005 --> 00:26:32.404
Why do I recall there being

00:26:32.564 --> 00:26:33.564
another person

00:26:33.725 --> 00:26:35.324
find the Soul Anchoring Lamp with me?

00:26:35.644 --> 00:26:36.564
You're wrong.

00:26:36.604 --> 00:26:37.884
There was no other person.

00:26:38.045 --> 00:26:39.072
Only you and me.

00:26:39.765 --> 00:26:40.564
Back then, we went

00:26:40.604 --> 00:26:42.208
through so much to make it happen,

00:26:42.525 --> 00:26:43.324
so don't wipe out

00:26:43.324 --> 00:26:44.205
your husband's credit

00:26:44.205 --> 00:26:45.245
just because

00:26:45.245 --> 00:26:46.164
you took a nap.

00:26:46.844 --> 00:26:48.124
Husband?

00:26:53.804 --> 00:26:54.925
It does feel hot.

00:26:55.084 --> 00:26:56.324
No wonder you're so confused.

00:26:57.925 --> 00:26:58.725
Master,

00:26:58.804 --> 00:27:00.544
the young master sneaked away
for training.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.712
Young master?

00:27:05.644 --> 00:27:06.404
You may leave.

00:27:06.404 --> 00:27:06.965
Yes.

00:27:10.005 --> 00:27:11.245
Our son.

00:27:11.364 --> 00:27:12.384
Son?

00:27:12.925 --> 00:27:15.904
You and me?

00:27:17.925 --> 00:27:19.584
He is too mischievous.

00:27:23.404 --> 00:27:23.925
Come on.

00:27:24.245 --> 00:27:25.045
Thank you.

00:27:25.324 --> 00:27:26.432
Why thank me?

00:27:28.045 --> 00:27:28.564
Oh, right.

00:27:28.884 --> 00:27:30.045
I have something for you.

00:27:30.124 --> 00:27:31.245
What is it?

00:27:33.364 --> 00:27:34.725
This is...

00:27:37.765 --> 00:27:38.485
This

00:27:39.045 --> 00:27:40.445
is our love token jade pendant.

00:27:46.765 --> 00:27:48.124
I once dreamed

00:27:48.285 --> 00:27:50.304
of attaining such happiness.

00:27:51.564 --> 00:27:52.644
Become the admired

00:27:52.765 --> 00:27:54.045
Head of Zhaohan Sect

00:27:54.045 --> 00:27:55.364
through my own efforts.

00:27:56.124 --> 00:27:57.124
And then,

00:27:57.245 --> 00:27:59.005
find a harmonious cultivation partner

00:27:59.124 --> 00:28:00.512
who shares my passions.

00:28:01.245 --> 00:28:03.168
We'll raise children together

00:28:03.485 --> 00:28:04.804
and keep a dog.

00:28:07.804 --> 00:28:08.644
So do I.

00:28:10.324 --> 00:28:12.005
As long as we can stay together,

00:28:12.324 --> 00:28:13.324
whether we ascend

00:28:13.324 --> 00:28:14.525
or stay in the Lingyou Realm,

00:28:14.804 --> 00:28:15.485
every day will be

00:28:15.485 --> 00:28:16.768
a blissful immortal life.

00:28:31.644 --> 00:28:32.884
Break the spell now.

00:28:32.884 --> 00:28:33.644
Stop this nonsense.

00:28:34.084 --> 00:28:35.804
I can wake her up.

00:28:35.884 --> 00:28:37.564
But I want to make a wager with you.

00:28:39.205 --> 00:28:40.525
Name your terms.

00:28:40.644 --> 00:28:41.324
Whether Ling Bo

00:28:41.324 --> 00:28:43.084
has true affection for you.

00:28:43.324 --> 00:28:45.205
Mortals never have true affection,

00:28:45.205 --> 00:28:46.205
only using one another.

00:28:46.364 --> 00:28:48.604
I once helped others sincerely,

00:28:48.685 --> 00:28:50.496
yet got sealed in a flowerpot.

00:28:51.164 --> 00:28:53.765
They're nothing
but treacherous schemers.

00:28:53.765 --> 00:28:55.084
You deserved it.

00:28:55.205 --> 00:28:56.285
You're incorrigible.

00:28:56.324 --> 00:28:56.965
Listen well.

00:28:57.005 --> 00:28:57.725
Right now, I want

00:28:57.725 --> 00:28:58.725
to bury you underground.

00:28:58.765 --> 00:29:00.164
You're scared to take the bet?

00:29:00.324 --> 00:29:01.525
Shall I tell you

00:29:01.564 --> 00:29:02.656
who played her husband

00:29:02.656 --> 00:29:03.925
in the illusion?

00:29:04.685 --> 00:29:05.364
No.

00:29:05.485 --> 00:29:06.324
I won't hear it.

00:29:06.564 --> 00:29:08.205
You don't dare to find out, do you?

00:29:09.205 --> 00:29:11.164
It was Xiao Dong!

00:29:11.925 --> 00:29:13.568
Stop spouting lies!

00:29:14.124 --> 00:29:16.164
Ling Bo sweet-talks you,

00:29:16.205 --> 00:29:18.464
but pines for another in her heart.

00:29:18.644 --> 00:29:19.904
In that illusion,

00:29:19.904 --> 00:29:21.408
she married him and bore his child.

00:29:21.408 --> 00:29:22.205
She's overjoyed.

00:29:22.324 --> 00:29:22.844
She forgot

00:29:22.844 --> 00:29:23.844
about you stinky fox.

00:29:23.844 --> 00:29:24.364
You...

00:29:31.205 --> 00:29:32.445
(This stupid lamp)

00:29:32.765 --> 00:29:34.144
(is plotting more tricks.)

00:29:34.445 --> 00:29:35.364
(Stay calm.)

00:29:35.644 --> 00:29:36.445
(I can't let it)

00:29:36.445 --> 00:29:37.525
(control me anymore.)

00:29:38.404 --> 00:29:41.084
(What's this thing's weakness?)

00:30:00.525 --> 00:30:01.285
Bugs!

00:30:01.285 --> 00:30:02.604
Help me catch it!

00:30:05.445 --> 00:30:07.040
Just let it crawl away.

00:30:13.124 --> 00:30:14.205
What's wrong with you?

00:30:14.245 --> 00:30:15.005
Didn't you always

00:30:15.005 --> 00:30:16.364
help me catch bugs before?

00:30:17.725 --> 00:30:19.084
It'll leave on its own.

00:30:19.245 --> 00:30:19.965
Calm down.

00:30:20.324 --> 00:30:21.485
Before?

00:30:22.525 --> 00:30:23.765
Before...

00:30:24.844 --> 00:30:26.765
It was Lin Hu catching bugs for me.

00:30:30.045 --> 00:30:31.285
Who's Lin Hu?

00:30:31.445 --> 00:30:32.205
Oh, right.

00:30:32.725 --> 00:30:33.804
It was Lin Hu!

00:30:33.884 --> 00:30:34.725
He came with me

00:30:34.725 --> 00:30:35.525
to find the Lamp.

00:30:35.525 --> 00:30:36.884
Lin Hu caught bugs for me.

00:30:37.445 --> 00:30:38.485
You're delusional.

00:30:38.644 --> 00:30:39.884
There's no such person.

00:30:40.005 --> 00:30:41.525
What's happening here?

00:30:55.245 --> 00:30:56.124
It turns out

00:30:56.765 --> 00:30:58.324
you're afraid of bugs.

00:30:59.285 --> 00:31:00.324
Listen up.

00:31:00.404 --> 00:31:01.925
Release Ling Bo

00:31:01.925 --> 00:31:03.205
this instant.

00:31:03.205 --> 00:31:03.808
Or else,

00:31:03.808 --> 00:31:04.525
I'll shove this

00:31:04.525 --> 00:31:05.804
filthy worm

00:31:05.804 --> 00:31:06.725
- in your mouth.
- Get it away.

00:31:06.844 --> 00:31:07.965
- Release her or not?
- Get it away now.

00:31:13.965 --> 00:31:15.104
You're not Xiao Dong.

00:31:16.005 --> 00:31:17.084
Who are you?

00:31:18.485 --> 00:31:19.205
Take a guess.

00:31:19.404 --> 00:31:20.604
Guess correctly,

00:31:21.045 --> 00:31:22.272
and I'll free you.

00:31:22.925 --> 00:31:24.324
You're the Soul Anchoring Lamp.

00:31:26.005 --> 00:31:27.285
Not entirely stupid.

00:31:27.604 --> 00:31:29.765
Wait, no. You're still stupid.

00:31:29.844 --> 00:31:30.725
You actually bought

00:31:30.725 --> 00:31:31.844
Lin Hu's lies?

00:31:32.445 --> 00:31:33.644
I'm telling you.

00:31:33.884 --> 00:31:35.525
He was afraid he couldn't beat me,

00:31:35.604 --> 00:31:36.445
so he left you alone

00:31:36.525 --> 00:31:37.525
in the woods

00:31:37.525 --> 00:31:38.404
and ran off himself.

00:31:38.884 --> 00:31:40.164
Who would believe you?

00:31:40.164 --> 00:31:40.925
Lin Hu would never

00:31:40.925 --> 00:31:41.965
abandon me.

00:31:45.285 --> 00:31:46.124
Have you forgotten

00:31:46.485 --> 00:31:47.564
his grand plan

00:31:47.564 --> 00:31:48.765
to marry eight vixens?

00:31:51.245 --> 00:31:53.844
Men's hearts cast wide nets.

00:31:53.844 --> 00:31:54.884
And he wants

00:31:55.005 --> 00:31:56.804
to catch

00:31:56.804 --> 00:31:58.525
fools like you.

00:31:58.604 --> 00:31:59.965
Enough nonsense!

00:31:59.965 --> 00:32:00.485
Just tell me

00:32:00.485 --> 00:32:01.472
where this place is.

00:32:06.884 --> 00:32:08.404
This is an illusion.

00:32:10.685 --> 00:32:11.525
Look.

00:32:12.245 --> 00:32:14.624
How perfect this illusion is.

00:32:16.324 --> 00:32:17.804
It has everything you desire.

00:32:18.564 --> 00:32:19.685
You're the Head.

00:32:20.124 --> 00:32:21.324
You also have

00:32:21.525 --> 00:32:24.672
a handsome and devoted husband.

00:32:25.248 --> 00:32:26.240
I've even prepared

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.445
a son for you.

00:32:27.725 --> 00:32:29.205
What more could you want?

00:32:31.776 --> 00:32:34.685
I want...

00:32:36.485 --> 00:32:37.164
No!

00:32:37.324 --> 00:32:38.205
No more tricks!

00:32:38.245 --> 00:32:39.324
Release me now!

00:32:39.712 --> 00:32:41.925
You foolish woman!

00:32:42.084 --> 00:32:43.364
Why leave?

00:32:43.364 --> 00:32:45.056
This illusion is wonderful.

00:32:45.056 --> 00:32:46.164
Look, everything's here.

00:32:46.205 --> 00:32:47.084
How often

00:32:47.084 --> 00:32:47.925
do wishes come true?

00:32:47.925 --> 00:32:48.804
You crave leadership

00:32:48.804 --> 00:32:49.725
and also love.

00:32:49.725 --> 00:32:51.045
Abandon this futile hope

00:32:51.045 --> 00:32:52.164
and stay here.

00:32:53.152 --> 00:32:54.528
Just stay here.

00:32:54.592 --> 00:32:55.164
Look!

00:32:55.404 --> 00:32:56.544
I specially crafted

00:32:56.544 --> 00:32:57.952
this illusion for you.

00:32:58.804 --> 00:32:59.884
Lin Hu doesn't truly

00:32:59.884 --> 00:33:00.765
care about you.

00:33:01.005 --> 00:33:02.965
He'll forget you eventually.

00:33:03.124 --> 00:33:04.096
Lin Hu won't.

00:33:04.324 --> 00:33:05.445
He'd never abandon me.

00:33:05.525 --> 00:33:06.884
Stop scheming.

00:33:06.884 --> 00:33:08.485
He will! He will!

00:33:09.725 --> 00:33:10.272
I...

00:33:11.045 --> 00:33:12.644
Get it away!

00:33:13.164 --> 00:33:14.164
Still not release her?

00:33:14.164 --> 00:33:14.804
Back off!

00:33:15.765 --> 00:33:17.344
I'll r-release her.

00:33:18.765 --> 00:33:20.084
I'll release her!

00:33:20.604 --> 00:33:21.364
Release or not?

00:33:25.604 --> 00:33:26.245
Ling Bo.

00:33:27.488 --> 00:33:28.768
Ling Bo, you're finally awake.

00:33:29.404 --> 00:33:30.364
What happened to me?

00:33:30.368 --> 00:33:31.005
You...

00:33:31.925 --> 00:33:33.205
You were hit by the lamp's

00:33:33.205 --> 00:33:33.765
Reverse Spell

00:33:33.765 --> 00:33:34.925
and trapped in its illusion,

00:33:34.925 --> 00:33:35.725
unable to escape.

00:33:36.564 --> 00:33:38.005
So that's what happened.

00:33:39.164 --> 00:33:39.725
Careful.

00:33:39.844 --> 00:33:41.324
You foolish lamp!

00:33:42.725 --> 00:33:43.804
You're finished!

00:33:43.968 --> 00:33:44.844
You can't hit me.

00:33:45.164 --> 00:33:46.765
I saved your life.

00:33:46.804 --> 00:33:47.648
To wake you

00:33:47.648 --> 00:33:49.024
from the illusion early,

00:33:49.024 --> 00:33:50.016
I cracked myself.

00:33:53.205 --> 00:33:54.564
It actually cracked.

00:33:54.644 --> 00:33:56.005
You're just a fragile lamp.

00:33:56.005 --> 00:33:56.804
Let me see.

00:33:57.324 --> 00:33:58.364
You deserve it.

00:33:58.404 --> 00:33:59.604
Let me tell you.

00:33:59.644 --> 00:34:01.564
You reap what you sow.

00:34:02.205 --> 00:34:03.604
I'm cracked.

00:34:03.725 --> 00:34:05.205
- I'm imperfect now.
- Wait.

00:34:05.205 --> 00:34:07.404
I'm flawed.

00:34:07.404 --> 00:34:08.864
I-It's cracked.

00:34:08.864 --> 00:34:10.925
Can it suppress Kong Hou's
dark cultivator blood?

00:34:10.925 --> 00:34:12.000
We must find a way

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:12.885
to fix it.

00:34:14.365 --> 00:34:16.284
But this is an ancient spiritual tool.

00:34:16.445 --> 00:34:18.204
We can't fix this ourselves.

00:34:19.965 --> 00:34:21.124
Someone can.

00:34:21.124 --> 00:34:21.644
Who?

00:34:21.644 --> 00:34:22.405
Xiao Dong.

00:34:22.604 --> 00:34:23.968
His magic includes

00:34:23.968 --> 00:34:25.376
methods for fixing spiritual tools.

00:34:25.824 --> 00:34:26.764
How do you know?

00:34:26.845 --> 00:34:28.005
You saw it earlier, right?

00:34:28.164 --> 00:34:29.485
What nonsense!

00:34:29.525 --> 00:34:30.525
Has this foolish lamp

00:34:30.525 --> 00:34:31.485
corrupted you?

00:34:31.965 --> 00:34:32.764
No.

00:34:33.445 --> 00:34:34.485
Let's go.

00:34:34.644 --> 00:34:35.564
Hurry and fix the lamp.

00:34:35.644 --> 00:34:36.845
If we waste time,

00:34:36.845 --> 00:34:37.885
Zhong Xi and Kong Hou

00:34:37.885 --> 00:34:38.885
will be worried.

00:34:42.244 --> 00:34:43.124
Fix you?

00:34:43.445 --> 00:34:44.684
You reap what you sow.

00:34:46.604 --> 00:34:48.284
You contributed the most

00:34:48.525 --> 00:34:50.724
on this visit to Liuguang Sect.

00:34:51.164 --> 00:34:52.704
As expected, we made

00:34:53.365 --> 00:34:54.752
those old fools obeyed obediently

00:34:55.164 --> 00:34:56.485
without bloodshed.

00:34:57.885 --> 00:35:00.564
Your Eminence,
you were magnificent today.

00:35:00.684 --> 00:35:03.204
I have a mere proposal.

00:35:03.365 --> 00:35:05.485
Wu Bei, what are you up to now?

00:35:10.204 --> 00:35:11.164
- Go!
- Go!

00:35:12.045 --> 00:35:12.764
Let me go.

00:35:12.805 --> 00:35:13.485
Kong Hou.

00:35:13.792 --> 00:35:14.432
Kong Hou.

00:35:15.644 --> 00:35:16.525
Tan Feng!

00:35:17.525 --> 00:35:18.485
Are you okay?

00:35:20.445 --> 00:35:21.604
Tan Feng, how are you?

00:35:23.204 --> 00:35:24.965
Your Eminence,
today is a joyous occasion.

00:35:25.045 --> 00:35:26.464
I have a humble proposal.

00:35:26.464 --> 00:35:28.256
Why not absorb spiritual energy

00:35:28.604 --> 00:35:30.525
from two disciples to liven things up?

00:35:40.485 --> 00:35:41.485
Wu Bei,

00:35:41.684 --> 00:35:43.840
calling you a fool

00:35:44.365 --> 00:35:46.496
would disgrace the term itself.

00:35:47.084 --> 00:35:49.405
The Ascension Array is approaching.

00:35:49.485 --> 00:35:51.040
We're in need of spiritual energy now.

00:35:52.084 --> 00:35:53.045
Yet you

00:35:53.084 --> 00:35:55.164
repeatedly waste it

00:35:55.244 --> 00:35:56.480
on personal grudges.

00:35:57.045 --> 00:35:58.688
Utter foolishness!

00:35:59.525 --> 00:36:00.485
My lord,

00:36:02.445 --> 00:36:04.204
I merely wanted to add some festivity.

00:36:04.845 --> 00:36:06.485
The Sovereign speaks wisely.

00:36:07.005 --> 00:36:08.124
Take them away.

00:36:08.164 --> 00:36:08.965
Yes.

00:36:09.925 --> 00:36:10.845
Kong Hou!

00:36:11.005 --> 00:36:11.965
- Kong Hou!
- Kong Hou!

00:36:11.965 --> 00:36:13.216
- Hurry! Move!
- Go!

00:36:16.405 --> 00:36:18.005
Can he actually fix it for us?

00:36:18.244 --> 00:36:19.365
Seriously.

00:36:20.576 --> 00:36:21.525
Xiao Dong.

00:36:23.284 --> 00:36:23.925
Ling Bo,

00:36:24.084 --> 00:36:25.365
I got your messenger talisman.

00:36:25.485 --> 00:36:26.045
I...

00:36:28.684 --> 00:36:29.284
Wait.

00:36:29.564 --> 00:36:30.445
Why that look?

00:36:30.485 --> 00:36:31.365
Didn't she tell you

00:36:31.365 --> 00:36:32.764
I'm accompanying her?

00:36:32.925 --> 00:36:33.764
She mentioned it.

00:36:33.925 --> 00:36:34.764
But...

00:36:34.764 --> 00:36:35.525
But what?

00:36:35.764 --> 00:36:37.485
He chose to ignore my presence, right?

00:36:37.485 --> 00:36:38.365
Enough.

00:36:38.644 --> 00:36:39.405
Is it the time

00:36:39.405 --> 00:36:40.485
for these conversations?

00:36:40.485 --> 00:36:41.084
No.

00:36:41.965 --> 00:36:42.724
Oh, right, Ling Bo.

00:36:42.764 --> 00:36:43.845
Your message mentioned

00:36:43.965 --> 00:36:45.525
needing me to fix something?

00:36:46.124 --> 00:36:47.005
Soul Anchoring Lamp.

00:36:49.045 --> 00:36:50.816
Soul Anchoring Lamp is no ordinary.

00:36:51.284 --> 00:36:52.525
Where did you acquire it?

00:36:52.764 --> 00:36:54.045
What's your purpose with it?

00:36:54.204 --> 00:36:55.204
Why so many questions?

00:36:55.204 --> 00:36:55.925
Fix it if you can.

00:36:55.925 --> 00:36:57.365
If not, forget it.

00:36:57.885 --> 00:36:58.445
Ling Bo,

00:36:58.644 --> 00:36:59.244
just tell me

00:36:59.244 --> 00:37:00.124
what's going on here?

00:37:00.204 --> 00:37:01.525
The messenger talisman was vague.

00:37:01.764 --> 00:37:02.445
And why would you

00:37:02.445 --> 00:37:03.445
team up with this guy?

00:37:04.325 --> 00:37:05.564
Team up with Lin Hu

00:37:05.604 --> 00:37:06.684
around?

00:37:06.845 --> 00:37:07.764
I fear he might...

00:37:07.805 --> 00:37:08.724
You fear what?

00:37:09.045 --> 00:37:09.885
Wait. We're at least

00:37:09.885 --> 00:37:10.764
fellow sect members.

00:37:10.764 --> 00:37:12.045
Do you distrust me so much?

00:37:12.204 --> 00:37:13.644
I'm worried you'll drag Ling Bo

00:37:13.644 --> 00:37:14.684
into danger.

00:37:14.684 --> 00:37:17.005
Soul Anchoring Lamp is
a spiritual tool to seal mountains,

00:37:17.045 --> 00:37:18.284
specifically for sealing souls.

00:37:20.445 --> 00:37:21.325
You...

00:37:21.445 --> 00:37:22.164
Exactly.

00:37:22.525 --> 00:37:23.445
We intend to use it

00:37:23.445 --> 00:37:24.445
for Kong Hou.

00:37:24.644 --> 00:37:25.764
Master Zhong Xi said

00:37:25.764 --> 00:37:26.764
it can help suppress

00:37:26.764 --> 00:37:28.005
her dark cultivator blood.

00:37:32.005 --> 00:37:33.204
Kong Hou is beyond salvation.

00:37:33.325 --> 00:37:34.805
She's a born dark cultivator.

00:37:35.405 --> 00:37:36.445
Soul Anchoring Lamp

00:37:36.925 --> 00:37:37.885
probably can't suppress

00:37:37.885 --> 00:37:39.325
the evil energy within her.

00:37:41.525 --> 00:37:42.284
Ling Bo,

00:37:42.885 --> 00:37:43.845
don't follow Lin Hu

00:37:43.845 --> 00:37:44.845
on this risky venture

00:37:45.164 --> 00:37:46.124
and help someone

00:37:46.845 --> 00:37:47.885
who isn't worth saving.

00:37:49.284 --> 00:37:50.204
My actions

00:37:50.365 --> 00:37:51.724
are my own choice.

00:37:51.885 --> 00:37:52.564
Ling Bo, you must

00:37:52.564 --> 00:37:53.445
not be foolish.

00:37:53.445 --> 00:37:54.724
Wait, Xiao Dong, are you okay?

00:37:54.724 --> 00:37:55.244
I just...

00:37:55.325 --> 00:37:55.925
Alright.

00:37:55.925 --> 00:37:57.056
Stop talking about these.

00:37:58.965 --> 00:37:59.644
Xiao Dong,

00:37:59.845 --> 00:38:00.684
take a look

00:38:00.724 --> 00:38:02.005
at how to fix the lamp first.

00:38:06.244 --> 00:38:07.244
Let me make this clear.

00:38:08.244 --> 00:38:10.005
I'm fixing this lamp not for Kong Hou,

00:38:10.845 --> 00:38:11.604
but for you.

00:38:15.244 --> 00:38:15.965
What?

00:38:16.124 --> 00:38:17.724
Am I invisible to you?

00:38:17.885 --> 00:38:18.764
You deliberately said

00:38:18.764 --> 00:38:20.204
- all those harsh words.
- Lin Hu,

00:38:20.724 --> 00:38:21.604
calm down.

00:38:24.204 --> 00:38:25.005
Xiao Dong,

00:38:25.604 --> 00:38:27.325
I know you resent Kong Hou,

00:38:27.684 --> 00:38:28.284
but you

00:38:28.325 --> 00:38:29.925
should trust Master Zhong Xi.

00:38:30.005 --> 00:38:31.204
This was his decision.

00:38:34.604 --> 00:38:36.445
Look, to be fair,

00:38:36.564 --> 00:38:37.965
Young Master is in her control now.

00:38:38.084 --> 00:38:39.325
If you fix Soul Anchoring Lamp

00:38:39.325 --> 00:38:40.204
and give it to her,
