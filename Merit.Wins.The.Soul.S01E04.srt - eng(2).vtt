00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
(This drama is based on
a true story.)

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
(The plot was adjusted
for entertainment purposes only.)

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
(We have no intention
to offend any careers,)

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.033
(encourage immoral sexual values,)

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:05.233
(or create a pessimistic disposition
of a gender or a group of people.)

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:07.833
(We would like to apologize in
advance for any misunderstandings.)

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.333
(Presents)

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.633
(Theory of Love)

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.800
Marry me.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.133
Until death do us part.

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.366
I asked her to marry me.

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.500
You’re my friend,
so please open up to her.

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.400
I’m giving her a chance

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.233
because I want to see
if she can actually change.

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.600
- Ouch.
- Bua.

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:45.400
You’re drunk. I’ll take you home.

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:50.000
Did Namhom really go back last
night to get her ring, Bua?

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.866
Yes, don’t overthink it.

00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.033
I know what to do
to find out the truth.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.100
Fon.

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:29.600
Were you looking through my phone?

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.300
No, I was tidying up
and it was about to fall.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.600
So I moved it.

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.466
Don’t touch my stuff again.
I don’t like it.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.300
You could say it nicely.
No need to get upset.

00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:44.600
You’re acting like there’s something
on your phone I shouldn’t see.

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:11.000
Your favorite.

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:26.000
Don't bother trying to impress me.

00:02:27.333 --> 00:02:28.400
All this time,

00:02:29.366 --> 00:02:30.566
I opened up to you

00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:32.400
and kept an open mind.

00:02:33.466 --> 00:02:34.500
But in the end,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.200
you made me realize

00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:37.633
that someone like you

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.300
can never change.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.833
From now on, leave me alone.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.966
Do you hate me that much?

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.133
Why don’t we start dating?

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.500
Are you crazy?

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.100
Do you even hear yourself?

00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:54.333
Yes, I know exactly what I’m saying.

00:02:54.866 --> 00:02:55.900
Do you?

00:02:56.466 --> 00:02:58.366
If I show Fon this photo,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.800
what do you think will happen?

00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:03.200
No matter what you tell her,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.600
she’ll never believe you.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.700
Do you know why?

00:03:08.966 --> 00:03:10.700
Because if she did,

00:03:11.033 --> 00:03:13.433
she wouldn’t be with me right now,
would she?

00:03:24.966 --> 00:03:25.966
Fine.

00:03:27.466 --> 00:03:28.833
I’ll date you.

00:03:30.533 --> 00:03:31.966
But you have to break up
with Fon first.

00:03:34.233 --> 00:03:36.666
Why? Don’t want to be
the other woman?

00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:39.000
You want to be my one and only?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.133
Right.

00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:42.366
Hey.

00:03:42.833 --> 00:03:44.266
Don’t flatter yourself.

00:03:44.966 --> 00:03:46.500
You’re not worth that much.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.900
Then why?

00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:53.766
Why?

00:04:11.033 --> 00:04:13.533
Fon, I’m worried about you.

00:04:14.166 --> 00:04:15.233
So what did you do?

00:04:16.066 --> 00:04:18.433
I secretly installed a tracking app
on Namhom's phone.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.200
Did you know

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.633
she put a tracking app
on your phone?

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.466
She knows exactly

00:04:30.966 --> 00:04:32.800
where you are and what you’re doing.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.466
Now do you see

00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:38.800
that my friend never really
trusted you?

00:04:40.633 --> 00:04:44.266
So no matter what I say,

00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:48.666
she’s going to break up with you
once she learns the truth.

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:53.933
That photo you’re
using to threaten me...

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.900
It’s useless now, isn’t it?

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.100
Fon.

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:42.633
We should break up.

00:05:43.566 --> 00:05:44.566
What?

00:05:44.566 --> 00:05:46.533
You secretly installed a tracking
app on my phone, didn’t you?

00:05:48.166 --> 00:05:49.766
I don’t want to hear
any more of your excuses.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.400
The truth is, you don’t trust me
and you never will.

00:05:54.066 --> 00:05:56.100
Our relationship is too toxic.

00:05:56.733 --> 00:05:58.466
It’s only going to get worse.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.800
We’ll just end up divorced anyway.

00:06:02.066 --> 00:06:03.466
No. I won’t break up.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.633
But I want to. I’m done.

00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:07.066
Let go.

00:06:07.666 --> 00:06:09.500
- No, Namhom. I'm sorry.
- Let go.

00:06:09.633 --> 00:06:12.966
I'm sorry. I’ll never do it again.
Please, Namhom.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Let go of me.

00:06:14.233 --> 00:06:15.233
No.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.600
- Let go of me.
- If we ever part,

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.533
let it be only because
death separates us.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.300
Let go.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.666
Do you know how many times
you’ve said you’d stop?

00:06:29.866 --> 00:06:31.566
If you’re not going to listen to me,

00:06:32.366 --> 00:06:33.500
then you can go die alone.

00:08:09.933 --> 00:08:11.266
I broke up with Fon.

00:09:00.433 --> 00:09:01.433
Fon.

00:09:01.966 --> 00:09:02.966
Fon!

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.333
Why are you doing this?

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.066
It’s my fault.

00:09:21.233 --> 00:09:23.733
I couldn’t keep her.

00:09:24.233 --> 00:09:25.933
You still have me.

00:09:32.133 --> 00:09:33.366
I'm here, aren't I?

00:09:40.366 --> 00:09:41.900
It's not your fault.

00:09:45.366 --> 00:09:48.566
I'm here for you.
Everything is going to be fine.

00:09:49.966 --> 00:09:50.966
No.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.433
Go to sleep.

00:10:09.633 --> 00:10:10.900
If you get too stressed,

00:10:11.533 --> 00:10:13.833
your old symptoms will come back.

00:10:17.333 --> 00:10:18.600
Thank you so much.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.633
You showed up just in time,
almost like you knew

00:10:22.133 --> 00:10:23.433
what I was about to do.

00:10:27.133 --> 00:10:28.766
I’m your friend.

00:10:32.166 --> 00:10:34.300
Friends stick together.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.400
It’ll be hard

00:10:41.566 --> 00:10:42.833
at first.

00:10:44.966 --> 00:10:46.500
You might still miss her.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.200
But with time,

00:10:51.133 --> 00:10:52.933
you’ll get better.

00:11:00.266 --> 00:11:01.966
Bua.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.466
Can I ask you for a favor?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.333
If Namhom still wants
to work with you,

00:11:12.266 --> 00:11:13.500
please give her a chance.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.233
I’ve been supporting her
financially.

00:11:17.966 --> 00:11:20.100
So if she has to live
on her own again,

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.166
at least she won't have a hard time.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.533
I’m sure she’s not really alone.

00:11:32.866 --> 00:11:33.866
Well...

00:11:35.233 --> 00:11:36.633
She broke up with you.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.366
She will date

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:40.366
someone else.

00:11:43.166 --> 00:11:44.166
Who knows...

00:11:45.366 --> 00:11:46.766
She might have already moved on.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Hold on.

00:12:07.433 --> 00:12:09.133
Don’t forget to keep your promise.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.300
Come on in.

00:12:43.433 --> 00:12:44.433
Namhom.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.500
I hope

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.800
you’ll leave my friend alone.

00:12:52.366 --> 00:12:54.600
Let her meet someone
who actually deserves her.

00:12:58.566 --> 00:12:59.566
Okay.

00:13:00.233 --> 00:13:01.233
I promise.

00:13:03.466 --> 00:13:05.600
And the photo?

00:13:07.533 --> 00:13:08.533
I deleted it.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.500
Where are you going?

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.466
Are you backing out on your promise
after you’ve gotten what you wanted?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.700
I just need some time.

00:13:29.533 --> 00:13:33.300
I just made my friend sad.
What more do you want?

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.100
Bua.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.433
You might think I asked you out
to tease you,

00:13:43.766 --> 00:13:45.066
but that’s not the case.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.833
When we slept together,

00:13:52.666 --> 00:13:54.266
it wasn’t a mistake.

00:13:54.933 --> 00:13:56.000
It was intentional.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.566
I know it was wrong,

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:03.766
but I couldn’t stop myself.

00:14:06.166 --> 00:14:07.166
I'm sorry.

00:14:14.833 --> 00:14:15.933
Let me ask you something.

00:14:18.966 --> 00:14:19.966
Do you think...

00:14:20.933 --> 00:14:22.100
if we got together,

00:14:23.533 --> 00:14:24.833
we would actually last?

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:29.500
You broke up with Fon,
but she still loves you.

00:14:31.366 --> 00:14:32.500
She’ll never be able to accept this.

00:14:36.833 --> 00:14:39.133
I don’t want
to think about the future.

00:14:42.633 --> 00:14:44.366
Right now,
I just want to be with you.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.833
Will you stay with me?

00:15:26.033 --> 00:15:27.033
What's up?

00:15:27.666 --> 00:15:30.400
How’s Namhom? Is she doing okay?

00:15:30.733 --> 00:15:31.733
Well...

00:15:36.633 --> 00:15:37.933
She’s fine.

00:15:38.966 --> 00:15:41.400
Thank you for giving her a chance.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.200
At least I’ll know how she’s doing
through you.

00:15:45.533 --> 00:15:46.533
Fon.

00:15:47.333 --> 00:15:48.933
If you keep this up,

00:15:49.733 --> 00:15:51.333
you’ll never be able to move on.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.500
I don’t want to move on yet.
I’m still hoping she’ll come back.

00:15:57.166 --> 00:15:58.800
I have to get back to work.

00:15:59.166 --> 00:16:00.333
Talk to you later.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.433
- All good?
- Yes.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.166
We need to brief her.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.433
- Okay, I'll do that.
- Sure.

00:16:11.666 --> 00:16:15.166
We’ll do as we discussed.

00:16:15.633 --> 00:16:18.166
Here you are. I was about
to call you over.

00:16:19.533 --> 00:16:20.533
Sit down.

00:16:21.166 --> 00:16:24.100
You’ve already seen the product.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.400
I want you

00:16:26.266 --> 00:16:27.266
to act naturally.

00:16:27.766 --> 00:16:29.233
And yes...

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:34.100
I just want a few shots
at the beginning.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.200
That’s it.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.400
Did the team send this to you?

00:16:38.233 --> 00:16:41.700
All right, do your best.
Break a leg.

00:16:42.633 --> 00:16:44.000
You're amazing.

00:16:55.733 --> 00:16:56.733
Hey.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.100
I’m sorry. It was an accident.

00:17:00.966 --> 00:17:03.733
But you need to be more careful.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.633
If it’s dangerous,

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.600
don’t get close.

00:17:11.033 --> 00:17:12.033
Guys.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.000
Please take care of her.
We'll take a break.

00:17:16.266 --> 00:17:18.700
Namhom, let’s talk outside.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.766
- You did that on purpose.
- Yes.

00:17:34.233 --> 00:17:35.333
Because she was flirting with you.

00:17:35.666 --> 00:17:37.900
I could tell right away
because I’ve done that myself.

00:17:38.466 --> 00:17:40.066
Don’t assume everyone is like you.

00:17:40.766 --> 00:17:42.433
No one said anything
when you did it,

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.300
so why are you bothered
when someone else does it?

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.766
I wouldn’t care if she flirted
with anyone else,

00:17:46.766 --> 00:17:47.766
but she was flirting with you.

00:17:50.966 --> 00:17:52.700
I’m your girlfriend.
I have feelings too.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.500
But here, you’re my subordinate.

00:17:55.433 --> 00:17:58.900
It doesn’t matter how upset you are.
You can't behave like this.

00:18:04.966 --> 00:18:06.666
If you can’t control yourself,
then go home.

00:18:08.133 --> 00:18:09.166
Don’t cause a scene.

00:18:10.866 --> 00:18:11.866
Fine.

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:14.300
Come to my place when you’re done.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.966
Did something happen
at work today?

00:18:58.666 --> 00:19:01.366
I’m spying on her at her place.
She didn’t go out.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.533
Did she go to work today?

00:19:04.766 --> 00:19:07.300
Now you’re spying on her
at her place?

00:19:08.066 --> 00:19:10.733
Like I said,
I’m not ready to move on yet.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:12.900
I don't know.

00:19:13.566 --> 00:19:14.600
She said

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.966
she was taking a half day.
I don't know what's up.

00:19:19.766 --> 00:19:21.466
Wait, hold on.

00:19:39.033 --> 00:19:40.033
Bua.

00:19:40.733 --> 00:19:41.966
I know what's up.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.300
She’s already moved on
with someone else.

00:19:47.633 --> 00:19:50.433
I told you to move on.

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:52.400
I have to go.

00:20:49.066 --> 00:20:50.300
Get out now.

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.300
You’ve got some nerve

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.500
to pull this on me.

00:21:12.366 --> 00:21:14.766
Why not?
You did it to me first.

00:21:15.533 --> 00:21:16.533
You let that girl flirt with you,

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.133
and you even defended her.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.333
- Come here.
- Ouch.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:26.700
Bua.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:27.833
- Come here.
- Bua.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Come here.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Bua.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.500
- Let go!
- Think I’m going to let it go?

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.800
Let go, Bua.

00:21:35.133 --> 00:21:36.133
- Let go.
- No.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:37.300
Let go!

00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:40.966
Ouch.

00:21:42.033 --> 00:21:43.200
Remember.

00:21:43.633 --> 00:21:46.266
I am not a good person,
like my friend.

00:21:46.366 --> 00:21:49.800
- Bua, let go.
- If you date me and do this,

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.433
then this is what you’ll get.

00:21:51.733 --> 00:21:53.800
Let go!

00:22:21.933 --> 00:22:24.200
For some people,
no matter how good you are to them,

00:22:24.466 --> 00:22:26.633
if they’re not grateful,

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.800
they’ll never treat you
the same way.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.400
I still believe my goodness
can change her.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.666
And what if it can’t?

00:22:36.833 --> 00:22:38.533
- No, Namhom. I'm sorry.
- Let go.

00:22:38.733 --> 00:22:41.600
If we ever part, let it be only
because death separates us.

00:22:42.366 --> 00:22:43.533
Then you can go die alone.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.066
Bua, she’s already moved on
with someone else.

00:23:09.133 --> 00:23:10.133
Hello?

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.866
Hey, is your girlfriend okay?

00:23:13.166 --> 00:23:15.400
The neighbor heard arguing,
and now it’s gone quiet.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.866
I knocked, but no one answered.

00:23:18.266 --> 00:23:19.300
Can you check on her?

00:23:20.266 --> 00:23:21.866
Okay, I’m on my way.

00:23:38.866 --> 00:23:39.866
Namhom.

00:23:42.866 --> 00:23:44.500
I don’t know how to love anyone.

00:23:45.433 --> 00:23:46.633
But I think you do.

00:23:46.866 --> 00:23:48.900
If you’re going to love someone,

00:23:49.133 --> 00:23:51.000
they must be really good to you.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.266
Fon.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:09.933
Thank you

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.533
for doing all that for me.

00:24:13.766 --> 00:24:16.500
Let’s be together.
I’ll be that person for you.

00:24:31.166 --> 00:24:33.600
Namhom!

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Namhom.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.433
Are you all right?

00:24:39.866 --> 00:24:40.866
Fon.

00:24:40.866 --> 00:24:42.566
It's okay.

00:24:43.333 --> 00:24:44.333
I'm here.

00:24:45.433 --> 00:24:46.433
All right?

00:24:47.566 --> 00:24:48.600
Don't be scared.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.033
Don't be scared.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.233
It's okay. I'm here for you.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.100
Are you hurt?

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.333
I'm sorry.

00:25:46.133 --> 00:25:47.300
For what?

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.166
I should be the one apologizing.

00:25:52.066 --> 00:25:55.100
What happened to you
was partly my fault.

00:25:57.633 --> 00:26:00.700
If I hadn’t upset you
and if we hadn’t broken up,

00:26:02.366 --> 00:26:04.200
you wouldn’t have gone out with him.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.100
None of this would’ve happened.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.933
Can I ask you something?

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.566
I know it’s not the right time,

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.100
but maybe

00:26:25.933 --> 00:26:28.900
your answer will help me understand
what’s in my heart.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.933
Did you ever love me?

00:26:40.533 --> 00:26:42.166
Even though I once told you...

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.433
if loving me is too hard,
then don’t do it.

00:26:47.033 --> 00:26:49.666
But deep down, I still hoped

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.300
that you would love me.

00:26:55.366 --> 00:26:56.366
Of course I do.

00:26:59.533 --> 00:27:00.966
Especially after everything
that’s happened,

00:27:03.066 --> 00:27:06.000
I realized how much I love you.

00:27:13.266 --> 00:27:14.966
Then stop apologizing

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.666
and let’s get back together.

00:27:19.433 --> 00:27:20.733
If you still love me,

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:22.800
let’s start over.

00:27:25.433 --> 00:27:27.800
I promise I’ll do better.

00:27:38.466 --> 00:27:39.466
I should be the one

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.033
saying that.

00:27:48.966 --> 00:27:50.800
If I ever get to be
your girlfriend again,

00:27:54.766 --> 00:27:56.833
I’ll be a better person.

00:27:58.333 --> 00:28:00.500
If anything makes you uncomfortable,

00:28:02.066 --> 00:28:03.066
I won’t do it again.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.500
But I won’t go back.

00:28:15.966 --> 00:28:16.966
Why not?

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.666
Because the person I’m seeing now
won’t accept that.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.266
I decided to commit.

00:28:46.666 --> 00:28:49.066
Please let me make my own choices.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.466
Aoy and Chod.

00:29:16.633 --> 00:29:21.233
Back then, I didn’t know who
Namhom was seeing

00:29:22.033 --> 00:29:24.600
or why she acted like she couldn’t
break up with that person,

00:29:25.566 --> 00:29:27.633
even though they had
probably just met.

00:29:30.766 --> 00:29:32.333
But I felt like

00:29:33.166 --> 00:29:36.600
I had to do something
to find out the truth.

00:29:40.466 --> 00:29:41.766
Excuse me.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.366
May I see the CCTV footage?

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:50.000
I want evidence of the guy
who hurt my girlfriend.

00:29:50.966 --> 00:29:53.300
I don't think it's a guy.

00:29:54.133 --> 00:29:55.133
What?

00:29:55.666 --> 00:29:58.166
The neighbor said it was a woman.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.300
Look.

00:30:06.033 --> 00:30:07.966
Are you sure this is the person?

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.833
Other than you, she’s the only one
who comes by often.

00:30:30.933 --> 00:30:31.933
What did you say?

00:30:32.166 --> 00:30:34.233
That’s what I heard.

00:30:34.433 --> 00:30:38.333
Namhom told Bua
that she’s her girlfriend.

00:30:38.866 --> 00:30:40.500
How is that possible?

00:30:41.033 --> 00:30:42.200
Namhom’s dating Fon.

00:30:42.533 --> 00:30:44.400
And Fon is Bua’s friend.

00:30:44.733 --> 00:30:45.733
That’s right.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.100
I can’t believe Bua would do this
to her own friend.

00:30:52.566 --> 00:30:53.566
Oh man.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.600
Did she hear us?

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:21.700
What's up?

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.366
Bua.

00:31:23.566 --> 00:31:25.266
Your friend Fon came to the studio,

00:31:26.066 --> 00:31:29.933
and she overheard us talking about
you and Namhom dating.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:31.600
What?

00:31:49.933 --> 00:31:50.933
Finally,

00:31:52.033 --> 00:31:53.933
I found out the whole truth.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.500
The person she’s dating
isn’t a guy like I thought.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:02.800
It’s my best friend.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.400
Fon.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.533
I’m your friend.

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.000
I just don’t want
to see you get hurt.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.700
Fon!

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Fon.

00:32:15.966 --> 00:32:18.433
Why are you doing this?

00:32:18.733 --> 00:32:19.733
I'm sorry.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.600
It's my fault.

00:32:30.566 --> 00:32:32.766
The two people I loved the most,

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:37.100
the two people
I tried my hardest for,

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.500
worked together and betrayed me.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:09.000
(Operating Room)

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.700
How is my friend?

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.466
The injuries from the accident
aren’t serious,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.566
but the reason
she lost consciousness

00:33:41.333 --> 00:33:43.000
is that her blood pressure
was extremely high.

00:33:43.533 --> 00:33:45.300
It caused her to have a stroke.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:49.533
We performed surgery
to remove the clot.

00:33:49.933 --> 00:33:53.266
She should wake up
within 24 to 48 hours,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.100
but we need to monitor her closely.

00:33:57.633 --> 00:33:59.633
How did this happen?

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.500
Based on her medical history,
she’s been at risk for a while now.

00:34:04.366 --> 00:34:07.100
The probable cause is stress.

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.200
Please excuse me.

00:35:43.033 --> 00:35:44.033
You should go in.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.400
Hey.

00:36:59.866 --> 00:37:00.866
How are you?

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.333
Don’t worry about that.

00:37:10.766 --> 00:37:12.966
I want to hear your excuse.

00:37:17.566 --> 00:37:19.266
What did I ever do to you

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.466
for you to do
something like that to me?

00:37:28.833 --> 00:37:29.833
You didn’t.

00:37:34.766 --> 00:37:36.700
You never did anything wrong to me.

00:37:40.133 --> 00:37:41.166
Then answer me.

00:37:43.166 --> 00:37:44.666
Why did you do it?

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.866
You were the friend
I loved and trusted the most.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.500
I have no excuse.

00:38:10.633 --> 00:38:12.033
Even if I tried to explain,

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.300
nothing I say would change anything.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.800
I know

00:38:38.866 --> 00:38:40.600
you don’t want to be
my friend anymore,

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:46.233
but let me take care of you

00:38:50.533 --> 00:38:52.133
until you recover.

00:38:55.766 --> 00:38:56.766
And...

00:38:58.933 --> 00:38:59.933
After that,

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.700
I’ll accept whatever you decide

00:39:09.666 --> 00:39:11.633
even if you still don’t want
to be friends.

00:39:20.066 --> 00:39:22.666
Are you sure you’re not going
to make any excuses?

00:39:41.433 --> 00:39:43.600
Then I can make my decision
right now.

00:39:48.633 --> 00:39:50.200
Don’t take care of me.

00:39:53.466 --> 00:39:54.766
Your duty

00:39:55.966 --> 00:39:57.033
is over.

00:40:19.433 --> 00:40:21.033
Thank you

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.166
for making me realize

00:40:28.633 --> 00:40:30.933
that my goodness can’t win
anyone’s heart.

00:41:35.666 --> 00:41:36.866
Aoy and Chod.

00:41:38.433 --> 00:41:41.033
Why did my goodness lose
to everything?

00:41:42.466 --> 00:41:45.166
Why can’t my goodness
win anyone’s heart,

00:41:46.066 --> 00:41:48.133
not even the people I love most?

00:41:56.066 --> 00:41:59.600
I want you to understand
and accept the truth.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.666
In any relationship,

00:42:01.933 --> 00:42:04.266
nothing is guaranteed.

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:08.333
Being good to someone doesn’t mean
they’ll love you back.

00:42:08.633 --> 00:42:11.866
Goodness and love
aren’t the same thing.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.733
And sometimes, the real problem

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.366
is that we give our goodness
to the wrong person.

00:42:27.533 --> 00:42:31.433
But I don’t want you to lose faith
in being a good person.

00:42:31.866 --> 00:42:35.533
What matters most
is being good to yourself.

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:37.533
Don’t let anyone hurt you

00:42:37.933 --> 00:42:40.233
just because they failed
to see your worth.

00:42:40.633 --> 00:42:45.000
I believe there are many good people
out there who deserve you.

00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:47.100
We’re all rooting for you.

00:43:36.733 --> 00:43:37.733
Hello.

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.800
Hello, I’m calling from the daycare.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:46.833
You called about transferring
your child to our center.

00:43:47.166 --> 00:43:49.133
We have a vacant spot now.

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.166
Would you like to confirm it?

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.400
Yes.

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.266
All right.

00:43:56.566 --> 00:43:58.533
Thank you. Bye.

00:44:14.866 --> 00:44:16.700
The new daycare is confirmed.

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.700
Please sign the documents.

00:44:20.733 --> 00:44:23.000
I’ll continue to support your child.

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.666
I’m not doing this for you.

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.166
I’m doing it for the child,

00:44:29.033 --> 00:44:32.766
someone I believe
will value my goodness.

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.033
(Baan Fah Mai Childcare Center)

00:44:48.933 --> 00:44:50.066
Hello.

00:45:12.666 --> 00:45:15.233
I signed the power of attorney
for you.

00:45:59.466 --> 00:46:02.800
Doing good brings good,
but not necessarily love.

00:46:06.933 --> 00:46:08.433
Happy Valentine’s Day.

00:46:08.666 --> 00:46:11.100
He gives me a gift and a card
on every occasion.

00:46:11.466 --> 00:46:14.400
All he lacks is a clear verbal
confirmation of who I am to him.

00:46:14.933 --> 00:46:17.633
They say it takes time
to truly get to know someone.

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:19.500
So I should be able to wait, right?

00:46:20.433 --> 00:46:21.433
Are you two together?

00:46:21.933 --> 00:46:24.033
Sandy was a junior at school.

00:46:24.233 --> 00:46:25.300
I like you.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:26.800
You like her, don't you?

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:28.533
We’ve known each other
for ten years.

00:46:28.633 --> 00:46:31.433
Almost ten years...
what was all of that?

00:46:31.433 --> 00:46:33.033
What am I to you?

00:46:33.933 --> 00:46:35.333
Did you fall?

00:46:35.333 --> 00:46:37.000
It was really bad.

00:46:37.233 --> 00:46:40.066
Then you can die alone.

00:46:40.366 --> 00:46:41.433
Wow.

00:46:41.433 --> 00:46:43.033
You're so weak.

00:46:43.933 --> 00:46:44.933
Why are you doing this?

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:48.700
Cut.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Amazing.

00:46:51.066 --> 00:46:52.066
Cut.

00:46:56.133 --> 00:46:57.133
She's sleeping.

00:47:00.533 --> 00:47:01.533
Action.

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:03.900
Oh no.
