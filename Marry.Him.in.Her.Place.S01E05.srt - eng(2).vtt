=Episode 5=

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.659
Who exactly are you?

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.179
Why did you approach me?
What's your purpose?

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.859
Was the explosion related to you?

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.579
You're asking so many things at once.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.979
I don't know which one
I should answer first.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.580
Let's see how long
you can keep pretending.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.419
Talk.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.379
Talk or not?

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.259
If you kill me,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.099
you'll never know anything about Xu Yin.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.740
Where is Xu Yin?

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.220
She's already dead.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.699
How did she die?

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.819
Xiao Mudan wanted to sell her
to Liu Kui.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.419
She refused to be humiliated,
so she jumped into the river and ended her life.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.340
You really don't want to live, do you?

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.619
At this point,

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.579
would there be any point
in lying to you?

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.939
There's a letter in my room.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.459
She wrote it to you before she died.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.100
If you don't believe me,
go read it yourself.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.939
(Lin Yun.)

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.419
(When you read this letter,)

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.259
(I should already be gone.)

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.019
(When I was ten,)

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.179
(you were badly injured saving me.)

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.459
(I started liking you back then.)

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.779
(The engagement my father
arranged before he died)

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.939
(made me truly happy.)

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.980
(But I knew you weren't willing.)

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.139
(I was kidnapped
and sold to Huaying Brothel,)

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.219
(Now,)

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.579
(I have even less courage
to see you again.)

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.859
(This necklace is the one
you gave me back then.)

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.699
(I'm returning it to you now.)

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.660
(Let our engagement end here.)

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.859
(Ling Yun,)

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.820
(farewell forever.)

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.139
I'm nothing but an orphan
abandoned by fate.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.899
Xiao Mudan needed to explain things
to Liu Kui,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.619
so she made me become Xu Yin.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.339
At Huaying Brothel,
I didn't tell you the truth

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.380
because you were the only one
who could save me then.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.539
Using my guilt toward Xu Yin
to deceive me.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.220
You really planned well.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.620
Where is she?

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.819
Xiao Mudan dumped her at a mass grave.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.099
I couldn't bear it,

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.259
so I asked someone
to secretly bury her here.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:18.300
(The Tomb of Xu Yin)

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.260
I'm sorry.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.539
I looked for you.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.100
I failed to protect you.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.660
Kneel.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.220
Kneel!

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.980
Bow your head.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.899
Now you should believe me, right?

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.699
You schemed to impersonate
Xu Yin and marry me.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.139
Then you tampered with the wedding.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.579
And you still say the explosion
had nothing to do with you?

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.100
Do you take me for a fool?

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.139
I have no grudge against Song Zhichu.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.259
What good would it do me to do that?

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.899
I only wanted to use Xu Yin's identity

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.660
to find someone powerful to rely on.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.499
And you think I'd believe you now?

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.259
At this point,
nothing you say matters anymore.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.419
Three days.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.500
Just three days.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.700
I'll find the person
behind the explosion.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.100
Fine.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.500
I'll give you three days.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.619
If you find the culprit,

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.780
everything between us
will be wiped clean.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.740
And you'll leave Chengyun Society.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.460
If you can't find them,

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.540
then the explosion
can only be your doing.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.140
I'll make you die with Xu Yin.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.580
Deal.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.459
Has she returned?

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.739
Not yet. She's been acting
mysterious these days.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.059
Leaving early and coming back late.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.900
She's been wandering
around the Liang Residence.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.660
The Liang Residence?

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:36.739
I want to see

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.580
what exactly she can find
in these three days.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.339
I've found the culprit.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.779
It was Madam Song's dowry maid,

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.980
Ruyi.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.980
What a coincidence.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.579
How do you prove it?

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.580
The relationship between Song Zhichu
and Ruyi is not simple.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.620
(Tonight midnight at Xianhe Residence)
(From Chu)

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.620
You're betting your life
on this piece of paper.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.100
(Tonight midnight at Xianhe Residence)
(From Chu)

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.979
Miss, why are you

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.099
reading the young master's
letters every day?

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.939
(Every love letter Song Zhichu
has written over the years,)

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.739
(I remember them vividly.)

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.020
(I couldn't be more familiar
with his handwriting.)

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.340
(I never thought it would come
in handy today.)

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.099
Go meet this Ruyi.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.980
Yes.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.219
Ruyi.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.139
As long as you answer
my questions honestly,

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.540
I'll let you go.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.300
I'm not finished yet.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.779
If you lie,

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.100
even a bullet won't spare you.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.580
Shh.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.340
You weren't at the banquet,

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.940
where did you go?

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:42.779
I…

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:43.979
What?

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.260
Having trouble answering?

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.299
My stomach wasn't feeling well,

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.179
so I

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.620
left for a while.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.500
Is the toilet of the Chengyun Society
on the east or west side?

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.819
East...

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:01.700
East side.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:03.940
Nonsense!

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.179
It's clearly on the north side.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.979
You planted the bomb in the cake.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.059
You wanted to kill Chief Song
and Madam Song, didn't you?

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:11.979
How could it be me?

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.100
How could I ever harm
my master and madam?

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.140
What's this?

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.259
Boss.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.339
It fell off her.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.020
What is this?

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.699
This isn't mine.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.379
I don't even know what that is.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.099
You ordered the cake.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.880
And that masked woman was you.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.299
Now the evidence is here.
Let's see how you deny it now?

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.980
It really wasn't me.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.259
- Beat her until she admits it!
- Yes!

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.099
It wasn't me!

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.139
You've got the wrong person!

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.540
It really wasn't me!

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:18.779
Madam Lin,

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:19.939
please save me.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.899
I didn't cause the explosion.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.539
Please help me send a message
to Chief Song.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.819
Ask him to save me.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.780
Chief Song?

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.259
Aren't you the maid who came
with the Liang family's dowry?

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.259
Why don't you ask your own
young lady to save you?

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.659
Chief Song treats
my young lady extremely well,

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.299
and he treats us servants just the same.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.979
In that moment,

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.300
I wasn't thinking straight.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.340
Oh really?

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.939
Your young lady

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.580
treats you well.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.979
I grew up together with my young lady,

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.180
naturally our bond is deep.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.059
Then why did you try to harm her?

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:01.699
No.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.100
I really didn't.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.420
What are you doing?

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.060
You don't remember where this bracelet
came from?

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:16.299
Miss.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.579
This jade bracelet is so beautiful.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.339
Do you like it?

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.420
Mm-hmm.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.060
I'll give it to you.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.300
Really?

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.020
Thank you, Miss.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:38.780
Ruyi.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.860
It's only been three months.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.020
You can't even recognize me?

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.539
Look carefully.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.180
Who do you think I am?

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.059
Impossible.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.980
Miss clearly died already.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.499
I didn't die.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.840
Heaven took pity on me.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.819
It let me live and return
to take revenge on you all.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:05.459
Impossible.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:06.179
No way.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:06.899
Impossible.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.179
No way.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.899
Ruyi.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.299
All these years I treated you
like my own sister.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.379
For a man like that,

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.700
was it worth it?

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.059
Zhichu said

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.939
he never really liked you.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.499
He married you

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.419
only because his father forced him.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.819
Lu Man

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.739
was just a puppet he brought back
to replace you.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.900
The one he truly loves is me.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.619
Once I am married,

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.979
I will be the real Madam Song.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.259
You really are foolish.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.659
Do you really think someone

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.859
who could kill his wife and father-in-law
on his wedding night would actually marry you?

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.259
Is this how you repay Liang family?

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.179
Tell me, where did Lu Man

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.539
who replaced me come from?

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.899
I don't know either.

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.779
She was brought back by Zhichu.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.140
So I would help confirm
Liang Yi's identity.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.820
All those who harmed our Liang family,

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.980
I will make you all accompany
my father in death, one by one.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.420
You're the first.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:17.819
Miss, I was wrong.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.339
I didn't mean to.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.539
I'm pregnant.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.220
I'm carrying Zhichu's child.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:23.179
Please.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.539
Don't kill me.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.659
It's all my fault.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.539
I listened to Zhichu's lies,

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.499
and did something wrong to you.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.099
But the child is innocent.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.059
Please spare me.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.380
Will you?

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.259
I beg you.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.980
Don't kill my child.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.579
You may stand up now.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:46.940
I won't kill you.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.979
Thank you, Miss, for sparing me.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.699
Since you already know my identity,

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.640
you can no longer stay in Rong City.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.840
I will arrange for someone
to send you away as soon as possible.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.259
Do not return.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.459
Otherwise, next time I see you,

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.979
I will definitely kill you.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:02.539
Okay.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.900
I will obey you.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:05.939
Chief Song.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:06.899
She is over here.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:07.859
Zhichu.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.380
So Miss...

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.320
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.920
How could the Liang family
young lady be fake?

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.939
I think you're just obsessed
with becoming Madam Song.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.240
- You even wanted to blow up Liang Yi.
- No, Zhichu. It was Miss...

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:39.979
The culprit has been found.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.299
Let's stop here.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.620
You've worked hard.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.259
After all, she's a Liang family maid.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.139
As for Madam Song...

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.859
I'll go explain to her side.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.220
You don't need to worry.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.300
Zhichu.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.340
Are you okay?

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.060
Just a servant.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.180
I'm leaving first.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.379
Boss.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.179
Tonight, while Song Zhichu
wasn't around,

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.779
we opened a few more Liang family
cargo boxes at the dock,

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.419
but still found nothing.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.059
Do you think it's possible that opium

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.539
has nothing to do with Song Zhichu?

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:52.680
The black market opium

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.360
started appearing the second year after
the anti-opium ban in Rong City.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.020
Coincidentally, that year,

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:01.219
Song Zhichu became police chief
thanks to his father's connections.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.579
Moreover, all these years,

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.299
no rumors ever leaked.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.019
Even I couldn't find out a thing.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.819
Who else in Rong City besides
the Song family

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.099
could have close merchant ties
with them?

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.219
It's only the Liang family.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.539
But Liang family cargo
never showed any issues.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.739
Song Zhichu is like a man
with three heads and six arms,

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.699
there must be channels for opium
to enter Rong City.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.179
The goods are fine,

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.139
it doesn't mean the Liang family
is without faults.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.619
Moreover,

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.460
Liang Wenbin died so mysteriously.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:36.859
Could it be that Song Zhichu killed him?

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.939
Liang Wenbin had an accident
on his wedding day.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.379
Song Zhichu had an affair with
his wife's personal maid.

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:46.179
The Liang family, proud of their status,
really couldn't catch a break.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.179
Moreover, the Liang family
young lady is very unusual.

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.859
Even we felt Liang Wenbin's
death was suspicious.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.059
But she not only didn't suspect,

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.739
she let Song Zhichu manipulate her.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:59.059
Liang Yi graduated
from Southern Women's University.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.819
It's said Liang Wenbin valued
this only daughter greatly,

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.859
raised her as his successor
since childhood.

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:09.620
So she must have been blinded
by Song Zhichu's sweet words.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.459
Unless...

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:15.659
Unless what?

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.459
Unless the current Madam Song

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.780
is not Liang Yi at all.
