[Six years ago]

00:00:49.098 --> 00:00:51.441
Maybe we could go to New Zealand together.

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.596
Don't joke around.

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:56.890
I'll take you seriously.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.525
I am serious.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:13.914
It's for you.

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:16.554
I quit smoking.

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.060
Why?

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.530
I don't need it anymore.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:33.134
Really?

00:02:12.825 --> 00:02:16.756
[Episode 3: Are you willing
to turn your world upside down with me?]

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:28.829
Do you really like this lighter that much?

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:35.687
I don't like this lighter.

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:39.995
I like this sound.

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:43.533
When I hear this sound,

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.793
I know...

00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:49.803
you're there.

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:55.969
So, you were looking forward to seeing me.

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:11.686
Seeing a man with such a nice butt
in the middle of the night

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:13.918
feels quite nice.

00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:20.653
Here's last week's receipt.

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:22.121
Thank you.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.324
Excuse me, I'd like to ask...

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:27.410
How much will my mom's
chemotherapy cost in total?

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.753
Please wait, I'll check for you.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.584
Here, let me explain.

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:36.085
There are four chemotherapy sessions in total.

00:05:36.085 --> 00:05:38.087
The self-paid medication and materials

00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:41.034
cost 413,000 yuan per session.

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:46.011
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:55.612
It's so dry.

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:57.482
Mom.

00:05:57.482 --> 00:05:58.608
Here's your lunch.

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:00.860
Look, isn't this lipstick color nice?

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.606
I borrowed it from Chubby,
but I didn't tell her.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.656
Where's Zhao Qiang?

00:06:05.656 --> 00:06:07.367
Didn't he say he was coming to see me?

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:08.826
I'm wearing this jacket.

00:06:08.826 --> 00:06:10.266
What do you think?

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:14.173
Zhao Qiang had a last-minute
business trip to the States today.

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:16.925
The States?

00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:21.547
Going to the States? That's not good.

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:24.384
Those foreigners are all fit.

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:25.635
They wear bikinis.

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:27.845
Or they'll just kiss each other.

00:06:27.845 --> 00:06:29.514
You're so out of shape.

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:32.308
If you're not careful, he'll be snatched away.

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:33.976
I'll call him. No, I'll video call him.

00:06:33.976 --> 00:06:36.104
- I'll talk to him.
- No, don't.

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:38.564
Why not? I'll talk to him.

00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:40.108
- I'll talk to him.
- No, don't.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:42.784
How can he video call you from the plane?

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:47.198
Do you think I don't know?

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:49.480
Are you lying to me?

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.662
I'm not lying to you.

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:54.615
But you better not lie to me.

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:57.633
It's strange.

00:06:58.292 --> 00:07:00.378
I haven't seen him for a while.

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:03.131
You have so many excuses for his absence.

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:05.800
Is there a problem between you two?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.844
Okay, stop pretending to be busy.
Come on, sit down.

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:09.262
Tell me the truth.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:11.514
- Sit down and talk.
- We're fine.

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:12.932
Remember to eat your food.

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:14.142
Pan Xin Tong!

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:15.768
Hey, you just got here.

00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:17.854
- Remember to finish it!
- Pan Xin Tong!

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:19.522
Pan Xin Tong!

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:21.315
I...

00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:22.824
Hey, I...

00:07:23.734 --> 00:07:25.069
Damn it!

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:27.013
She ran like a bat out of hell.

00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:40.592
I'm sorry.

00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:45.097
- Are you okay?
- Get out of here now!

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:48.176
I'm sorry!

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:51.512
I wanted you transferred
to the chairman's secretary's office.

00:07:51.512 --> 00:07:54.348
Mr. Zhan agreed.

00:07:54.348 --> 00:07:56.267
What about Ms. Zhou?

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:58.068
She's fine with it.

00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:38.150
You're back.

00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:45.983
The coffee is ready.

00:08:45.983 --> 00:08:47.256
Okay.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.326
About the investment proposal...

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:59.629
I called all the investors
and told them to cancel things.

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:03.876
And the diamond ring at the auction...

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:06.678
I asked Mrs. Wang to take over.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.030
Don't be mad, okay?

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:18.023
If anything happens in the future,
we can talk about it.

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:26.040
I'm going to take a shower.

00:09:47.795 --> 00:09:49.880
Chief Secretary.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.099
- Over there.
- Okay.

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:08.691
That's work information.

00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:11.027
This is the list of board members.

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:12.570
Take some time to go through it.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.946
Okay.

00:10:13.946 --> 00:10:17.491
Also, please help Ms. Zhou
with her work and daily tasks.

00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:18.959
Oh, right.

00:10:20.077 --> 00:10:21.203
This is it.

00:10:21.203 --> 00:10:23.331
It's Ms. Zhou's menstrual cycle.

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:25.041
You need to help keep track of it.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.292
When she's ovulating,

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.753
try to arrange a meal with Mr. Zhan.

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:31.547
Why do I have to manage
her menstrual cycle too?

00:10:31.547 --> 00:10:33.924
After Mr. Zhan's son
was involved in an accident,

00:10:33.924 --> 00:10:36.552
he had his vas deferens reconnected.

00:10:36.552 --> 00:10:39.013
He said he wanted to bring
his dead son back to life.

00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:42.391
But Ms. Zhou isn't very proactive
about getting pregnant.

00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:45.478
You need to pay more attention to that.

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.438
This job is so strange.

00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:49.065
What's so strange about it?

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:51.901
It's not strange if the salary is high.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.944
That's true.

00:10:53.944 --> 00:10:58.240
I just didn't expect this job
to involve the boss's girlfriend.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.701
This is a special situation.

00:11:00.701 --> 00:11:03.837
You'll still be busy
with company affairs later.

00:11:10.267 --> 00:11:12.415
[Grave of Late Father]

00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:19.845
Dad.

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:22.991
Up in heaven, you must still be
riding your motorcycle.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:32.525
If your dad were still alive,

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:35.327
things would be different now.

00:11:37.738 --> 00:11:41.052
He would've told you not to be so stubborn.

00:11:47.289 --> 00:11:49.477
I just can't let go.

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:53.504
Back then, the chairman of Hongfa Group

00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:55.840
should have been your dad.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.342
I didn't expect Mr. Zhan to take the title.

00:11:58.342 --> 00:12:01.436
Now, we only have Snobis left.

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:07.101
Mom, that's because Mr. Zhan is capable.

00:12:07.101 --> 00:12:08.936
You've always been unconvinced.

00:12:08.936 --> 00:12:11.518
And then you project the stress onto me.

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:16.235
Don't blame me for being too strict.

00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:19.488
Getting Hongfa back
and putting it in your hands

00:12:19.488 --> 00:12:22.658
is my biggest wish in life.

00:12:22.658 --> 00:12:25.161
I won't give up.

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:30.291
But now, you can't even trust me with Snobis.

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:32.498
Why talk about Hongfa?

00:12:33.127 --> 00:12:35.254
Am I wrong?

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:37.965
You're making all the decisions now.

00:12:37.965 --> 00:12:42.511
My title of vice president is an empty one.

00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:45.347
I only have one identity.

00:12:45.347 --> 00:12:48.392
That's Ms. Qian Li Hua's son.

00:12:48.392 --> 00:12:50.102
If you did a good job,

00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:51.896
would I need to manage so much and be so tired?

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:55.524
That's because you've never had faith in me.

00:12:55.524 --> 00:12:57.651
I had many innovative ideas for the company.

00:12:57.651 --> 00:12:59.361
But you kept shooting me down.

00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:02.156
Now, all the employees look down on me.

00:13:02.156 --> 00:13:04.366
I'm dispensable.

00:13:04.366 --> 00:13:06.835
What's the point of going to work daily?

00:13:15.336 --> 00:13:16.845
All right.

00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:19.590
From now on, whatever you decide,

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.973
tell them not to ask me.

00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:24.477
Do you mean it?

00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:28.307
Dad.

00:13:28.307 --> 00:13:30.726
I'm sure you heard Mom.

00:13:30.726 --> 00:13:33.312
Mom said she's willing to let go.

00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:35.022
Don't get ahead of yourself.

00:13:35.022 --> 00:13:39.075
If you don't do well,
I'll take back my words right away.

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:56.669
These supplements and health foods
are all from Mr. Zhan.

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:59.088
They have different effects and intake times.

00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:02.557
They're all marked for you,
just take them accordingly.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.520
Xiao Qi, are you listening to me?

00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:12.101
Hello?

00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:15.153
Don't you think your job is meaningless?

00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:18.732
It is meaningless.

00:14:18.732 --> 00:14:20.825
But it's my job.

00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:25.865
I don't want to do what Mr. Zhan
told me to do either.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:28.416
So, I took the liberty of making this.

00:14:33.455 --> 00:14:36.834
I've compiled a list of all the artists
you've transacted with.

00:14:36.834 --> 00:14:38.168
I've also compiled their future exhibitions

00:14:38.168 --> 00:14:40.462
and auction prices into a file.

00:14:40.462 --> 00:14:41.881
This way, you'll get a clear picture.

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:42.882
Thank you.

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:44.258
But I've memorized them all in my head.

00:14:44.258 --> 00:14:45.676
Not on the computer.

00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:48.144
You know pregnancy can lead to
"goldfish brain," right?

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.020
What I mean is...

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.416
relying on the computer is safer.

00:15:03.881 --> 00:15:05.501
Give me a second.

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:16.957
You'll come to the gallery with me from now on.

00:15:16.957 --> 00:15:19.084
Don't worry about my womb.

00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:20.794
It's annoying.

00:15:20.794 --> 00:15:22.254
Wear these.

00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:24.431
Don't embarrass me.

00:15:30.554 --> 00:15:32.139
Thank you, Xiao Qi.

00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:33.938
See you.

00:16:09.176 --> 00:16:10.583
Hello?

00:16:31.448 --> 00:16:33.081
Ms. Pan.

00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:36.704
I'm sorry, we were busy this morning.

00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:41.793
Sir.

00:32:41.793 --> 00:32:43.806
Do you need help?

00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:50.533
You really are such a good storyteller.

00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:56.990
Want to grab a bite?

00:34:48.628 --> 00:34:50.254
Regarding the next marketing project,

00:34:50.254 --> 00:34:51.631
I personally have some ideas.

00:34:51.631 --> 00:34:53.966
We must break away from old ways

00:34:53.966 --> 00:34:56.260
and expand into new types of stores.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:35:00.556
I propose we combine coffee
and makeup products.

00:35:00.556 --> 00:35:03.434
While drinking coffee,
we can try out makeup products.

00:35:03.434 --> 00:35:05.061
With this concept of a hybrid store,

00:35:05.061 --> 00:35:08.106
we can attract more adventurous customers.

00:35:08.106 --> 00:35:09.315
The proposal in your hands

00:35:09.315 --> 00:35:11.442
includes our budget for this proposal.

00:35:11.442 --> 00:35:14.112
Our team has already reached
the implementation stage.

00:35:14.112 --> 00:35:17.706
If anyone has any questions,
please feel free to ask.

00:35:18.574 --> 00:35:21.494
Let's postpone this proposal for now.

00:35:21.494 --> 00:35:24.463
Are there any other departments
that need to make reports?

00:35:33.131 --> 00:35:34.590
What do you mean?

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:36.342
Didn't you say you'd let me decide?

00:35:36.342 --> 00:35:38.511
I did agree to let you decide.

00:35:38.511 --> 00:35:40.771
But your proposal is too risky.

00:35:42.431 --> 00:35:44.684
It's good for young people to be creative,

00:35:44.684 --> 00:35:47.687
but you can't be too unrealistic.

00:35:47.687 --> 00:35:49.355
A hybrid store might initially

00:35:49.355 --> 00:35:51.399
generate buzz and popularity.

00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:53.025
But once the novelty wears off,

00:35:53.025 --> 00:35:54.569
we're sure to lose money.

00:35:54.569 --> 00:35:55.987
I can't let you play around like that.

00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:57.738
We already have concrete methods
to maintain popularity.

00:35:57.738 --> 00:36:00.658
It's all in our proposal.
You didn't even read it.

00:36:00.658 --> 00:36:03.168
Can you stop being so negative
about your own son?

00:36:12.712 --> 00:36:14.207
How about this?

00:36:15.173 --> 00:36:16.215
If you go to the United States

00:36:16.215 --> 00:36:19.685
and secure the exclusive
distribution rights for the fashion brand,

00:36:20.386 --> 00:36:22.638
I'll reconsider your proposal.

00:36:22.638 --> 00:36:25.148
And I'll acknowledge your ability.

00:36:29.061 --> 00:36:31.189
If I really succeed in getting the deal,

00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:33.054
you can't deny me anymore.

00:36:33.816 --> 00:36:35.193
Of course.

00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:38.537
I'm the one who wants to
see you succeed the most.

00:36:41.824 --> 00:36:44.535
I'll only give you one week.

00:36:44.535 --> 00:36:47.330
It's my birthday when you get back.

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:49.415
I've invited a few friends to dinner.

00:36:49.415 --> 00:36:51.834
I also invited Lin Feng Hua.

00:36:51.834 --> 00:36:55.804
This time, you must
seize the chance to woo her.

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:29.171
I'm leaving.

00:37:30.206 --> 00:37:32.244
Stay with me a little longer.

00:37:38.631 --> 00:37:41.058
I'm having dinner with her.

00:38:03.072 --> 00:38:04.462
Hello?

00:38:08.452 --> 00:38:10.371
Okay.

00:38:10.371 --> 00:38:11.755
Thank you.

00:38:19.171 --> 00:38:20.789
What's wrong?

00:38:34.562 --> 00:38:36.975
Go somewhere with me tomorrow.

00:38:54.707 --> 00:38:57.043
- Hi, Xin Tong.
- Hi, Tony.

00:38:57.043 --> 00:38:59.003
- Hi.
- I'll go over the playlist with you later.

00:38:59.003 --> 00:39:01.049
Okay, no problem.

00:39:06.635 --> 00:39:09.263
Why haven't I seen the boss
for the past few days?

00:39:09.263 --> 00:39:11.731
He'll be in the U.S. for a short business trip.

The nursing home called me yesterday.

00:40:33.514 --> 00:40:36.976
They told me my dad is having surgery.

00:40:36.976 --> 00:40:39.266

Are we close enough
to meet each other's parents now?

00:41:07.882 --> 00:41:09.425
I thought there was a monster in there.

It's your dad.

00:41:10.968 --> 00:41:12.261
Hurry up and go.

00:41:13.679 --> 00:41:15.948

I've never given birth. How would I know?

After I give birth,
I'll tell you if it hurts, okay?

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.533
Then hurry up and give birth.

00:42:57.533 --> 00:42:59.785
Don't make me wait too long.

You don't get along with your dad.

He's a jerk.

Because of him,

my mom...

00:44:25.663 --> 00:44:27.538
was paralyzed.

She can't even speak.

She's in a wheelchair.

My dad still exploits her
in front of the media.

He pretends to be a good family man.

00:44:43.639 --> 00:44:45.974

It does.

His name is Georg Baselitz.

00:45:53.292 --> 00:45:55.593
He painted upside down.

00:45:56.295 --> 00:46:00.466
At first, I didn't understand
why he painted like that.

00:46:00.466 --> 00:46:03.059
But later on, I think I got it.

00:46:04.136 --> 00:46:06.430
In his paintings,

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:08.348
although it's chaotic,

00:46:08.348 --> 00:46:10.356
it has its own rules.

00:46:11.935 --> 00:46:14.622

and jumped off our rooftop.

but became a vegetable.

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:30.056

not the world.
